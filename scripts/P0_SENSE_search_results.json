        "content": "many of the advancements that were released in with the large push for VR devices in 2016. Even devices such as the Microsoft Hololens, which was released in 2016, had rudimentary hand tracking that did successfully track the hand, but with significant latency and poor finger segmentation. Many older technologies would have to pick between either accuracy or speed, however newer offerings have helped reduce these issues significantly. 30 2.1.3.2 Passive Interactions Many modern VR systems make heavy use of ray-cast techniques, with ecosystems such as SteamVR and Oculus using these for their menu and interface interactions, and toolkits such as the MRTK (Microsoft 2019b) using them for a hybrid approach to object interaction. In the case of interface interactions, these are generally a [...] the case of interface interactions, these are generally a simple ray that directly and linearly extends from a controller or hand and is then actioned through generic button or gesture. Object interaction is a more varied field, where systems are often seen to be adding additional helper functions to the rays. For example, the MRTK warps and bends the ray to snap towards an object within close vicinity. Crucially ray-cast based interactions tend to be most favourable when they are instantaneous to react and linked to a hand based-origin. A study by (Nukarinen et al. 2018) found that the rays with time based hover interactions were less favourable than instantaneous button based interactions, while hand origins were favoured over head. This builds upon prior research by (Cournia et al. [...] in the center of the image to the left of the keyboard, demonstrating hand tracking. (Ultraleap 2013) Hand tracking hardware and software has been commercially available for a number of years. Devices such as the Leap Motion Controller (Leap Motion 2013), shown in Figure 11, and Microsoft Azure Kinect (Microsoft 2019a), and prior iterations, have allowed users to track their hands (Hald 2013). Several computing platforms are now starting to integrate hand tracking directly into the hardware of the device such as: the Oculus Quest (Oculus 2019b) Figure 12, Hololens 2, and Varjo VR-2 Pro (Varjo 2019), removing the necessity for users to obtain additional hardware. This seamless integration will not only help improve the adoption but also massively increase the user base of the tech. Figure",

This means it's sometimes difficult to determine whether your hand is behind or in front of a hologram to precisely grab a manipulation widget, for example.\n Where to: Use information about what a user is looking at with quick-throwing gestures. Grab a hologram and roughly toss it toward your intended destination.\n\n  While this sometimes works, quickly doing hand gestures may result in highly inaccurate destinations. However, eye tracking could improve the accuracy of the gesture.\n\n## Manipulation in MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit) for Unity [...] The first mechanism is a bounding box with a proximity shader, which is detailed in the previous section. It gives users a better sense of proximity when they approach and make contact with a button.\n The second mechanism is depression. Depression creates a sense of pressing down after a fingertip contacts a button. The mechanism ensures that the button tightly moves with the fingertip along the depth axis. The button can be triggered when it reaches a chosen depth (on press) or leaves the depth (on release) after passing through it.\n The sound effect should be added to enhance feedback when the button is triggered.\n\nFinger is far away\n\nFinger approaches\n\nContact begins\n\nPress down\n\n## 2D slate interaction",
