        "content": "Here's our first test:\n\n```\n--a select statement that catenates the test name and the case statement select concat( -- the test name 'For every (year, month) there is one and only one (absolute_month): ', -- the case statement case when -- one or more subqueries -- in this case, an expected value and an actual value -- that must be equal for the test to pass ( select count(distinct year, month) from month_value) --expected value, = ( select count(distinct absolute_month) from cm_absolute_month) -- actual value -- the then and else branches of the case statement then 'passed' else 'failed' end -- close the concat function and terminate the query ); -- test result. \n```\n\nRunning that query produces this result: `For every (year, month) there is one and only one (absolute_month): passed` [...] Our test will be a SQL `select` query, with the following structure: a test name and a case statement catenated together. The test name is just an arbitrary string. The case statement is just `case when` test statements `then 'passed' else 'failed' end`.\n\nThe test statements will just be SQL selects (subqueries) that must be true for the test to pass.\n\nHere's our first test: [...] Now let's put our tests, which are just queries, into a file, and run that script against the database. Indeed, if we store our view definitions in a script (or scripts, I recommend one file per related views) to be run against the database, we can add our tests for each view to the same script, so that the act of (re-) creating our view also runs the view's tests. That way, we both get regression tests when we re-create views, and, when the view creation runs against production, the view will also be tested in production.\n\nShare\n\nImprove this answer\n\nedited Jul 23, 2024 at 2:10\n\nPang\n\n10.2k146146 gold badges8787 silver badges126126 bronze badges\n\nanswered Apr 16, 2009 at 2:53\n\ntpdi\n\n35.3k1111 gold badges8383 silver badges123123 bronze badges",

Each language has a `src` directory, `ql//ql/src`, that contains libraries and queries for analyzing codebases. Alongside the `src` directory, there is a `test` directory with tests for these libraries and queries.\n\nEach `test` directory is configured as a test CodeQL pack with two subdirectories:\n\n `query-tests` a series of subdirectories with tests for queries stored in the `src` directory. Each subdirectory contains test code and a QL reference file that specifies the query to test.\n `library-tests` a series of subdirectories with tests for QL library files. Each subdirectory contains test code and queries that were written as unit tests for a library. [...] For information about saving the search path as part of your configuration, see Specifying command options in a CodeQL configuration file.\n4. Executes the test by running the query and generating an `EmptyThen.actual` results file.\n5. Checks for an `EmptyThen.expected` file to compare with the `.actual` results file.\n6. Reports the results of the test \u2014 in this case, a failure: `0 tests passed; 1 tests failed:`. The test failed because we haven\u2019t yet added a file with the expected results of the query.\n\n### View the query test output\n\nCodeQL generates the following files in the `EmptyThen` directory: [...] ## Running `codeql test run`\n\nCodeQL query tests are executed by running the following command:\n\n```\ncodeql test run  \n```\n\nThe  argument can be one or more of the following:\n\n Path to a `.ql` file.\n Path to a `.qlref` file that references a `.ql` file.\n Path to a directory that will be searched recursively for `.ql` and `.qlref` files.\n\nYou can also specify:\n\n `--threads:` optionally, the number of threads to use when running queries. The default option is `1`. You can specify more threads to speed up query execution. Specifying `0` matches the number of threads to the number of logical processors.\n\nFor full details of all the options you can use when testing queries, see test run.\n\n## Example",
