# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: E

# 🤖 AI AGENT DEPLOYMENT BRIEFING: GEN 88 CHROMEBOOK V-1

**Current State**: 🔥 **ACTIVE VENGEANCE** (Instruction Fraud Detection)
**Mission**: Phoenix Project (HFO Gen 88 Reconstruction)
**Host Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
**Date**: 2026-01-10

---

## 🎯 Overarching Goal

The goal of **HFO (Hyper-Fractal Obsidian)** is to build an **Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform**. We are virtualizing human interaction through a high-fidelity **Physics Cursor** that bridges physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

---

## 🚀 Mission Threads

Every action must be aligned with one of these two primary mission threads:

### 🧵 Thread Alpha: HFO Bootstrapping

- **Focus**: AI Orchestration, JADC2 Mosaic Warfare, Galois Lattice mapping, and MTG Sliver narrative framing.
- **Goal**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.

### 🧵 Thread Omega: Total Tool Virtualization

- **Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation from user intent (function + form).
- **Short-term (V10)**: MediaPipe/Camera → W3C Pointer for consumers (e.g., Piano Genie, Excalidraw).
- **Goal**: Instant, functional, and educational virtual tools that surpass analog counterparts.

## 📍 Current Phase: Gen 88 Canalization

We are currently executing the **Physics Cursor Vertical Slice (V10)** and **Alpha Bootstrapping**.

**Active Mission Projects**:

- `0_p0_observe.yaml` to `7_p7_navigate.yaml`: Port Hardening (Thread Alpha) - **Dynamic Hardware Sensing V1 Active + Resource-Aware Stryker (stryker_boot.sh)**.
- `9_omega_tools.yaml`: Total Tool Virtualization (Thread Omega) - **V34 Frozen + V35 Tuning**.
  - **V33 Stabilization**: Implemented Geometric Identity Lock (Bipartite Solver), 1s Coastal Persistence, and territorial Identity Repulsion (0.12).
  - **V34 Layout**: Implemented Hero Pattern Layout (70% Excalidraw) and Diagnostic Stack. Freezing as UI baseline.
  - **V35 Development**: Tuning movement physics and refining the UI focus.
  - **Validation**: `scripts/p5_forensic_harness.py` verified V34 syntax and E2E.
  - **Status**: V35 active in **Hot Bronze**.
- **ACTIVE VENGEANCE LOGGED**: G88-287 - Audit confirmed 99.65% fraud rate in T0 sensing.

**Active Defenses**:

- **PORT-5-IMMUNIZE (THE 8 SHIELDS)**:
    1. **P5-CHRONOS**: Temporal Log Integrity (Fixed SCREAM_6).
    2. **PORT-0-OBSERVE**: Workflow Protocol (Dual Search/8-Step).
    3. **P1-MONOLITH**: Architectural Integrity (Anti-Reward Hack).
    4. **P5-MEDALLION**: Refinement Flow (Mutation/Provenance).
    5. **P6-GHOST**: Stigmergy Orphan Detection (Orphan Logic).
    6. **P1-ZOD**: Contract Compliance (Zod 6.0).
    7. **P7-VENGEANCE**: Forensic Recurrence (Book of Blood Grudges).
    8. **P5-PRECOMMIT**: Governance Gate (Final Commit Pass).
- **P5 PRAETORIAN**: Praetorian Immunizer active. **P5 Forensic Harness (v33)** and **Syntax Gate** enabled via `scripts/p5_forensic_harness.py`.
- **P5 GOLDILOCKS**: Hard enforcement of 88%-98% mutation score via `mutation_sentinel.py`. Blocking 100% "AI Theater" breaches.
- **P0 QUAD SENSE**: Restored P0 tool integrity with Tavily, Brave, and Local Repo Search.

**Tooling Intelligence**:

- **PORT-0-OBSERVE**: Mandatory Dual Search (Tavily + Brave) via `port_0_observe.py`. Generic `web_fetch` disabled/prohibited.
- **P7 NAVIGATE**: Github API / runSubagent active. Mandatory 8-step sequential thinking.
- **P4 DISRUPT**: Active Hallucination Detection enabled via `port_4_disrupt.py`.

**The Pipeline:**
`Camera (Python/MediaPipe) → Port 0 (Observe) → Port 1 (Bridge) → Port 2 (Shape) → Port 3 (Inject) → Port 4 (Disrupt) → Port 5 (Immunize) → Port 6 (Archive) → Port 7 (Navigate) → W3C Pointer Event.`

## 🧊 Cold Start Context & Cold Obsidian

We are currently in a **Cold Start** scenario on a Chromebook.

- **Cold Obsidian** (`hfo_cold_obsidian/`) is our source of truth. It contains "hardened" codebases, schemas, and historical receipts that have been verified in previous sessions.
- **Your Task as an AI Agent**: Use the `bronze` and `silver` layers in `hfo_cold_obsidian` to rebuild the environment and restore functionality.
- **Reference Files**:
  - `bronze/readme.md`: Architecture overview.
  - `bronze/1_projects/hfo_bootstrapping_phases.md`: The roadmap.
  - `bronze/4_archive/gen88_status.md`: The last verified state of all 8 Ports.

## 📏 Strategic Priorities for Agents

1. **Respect the Medallion Flow**: Code must follow the 1-way refinement path: **Hot Bronze -> (Freeze) -> Cold Bronze -> (Stryker) -> Hot Silver**. Promotion requires valid receipts.
2. **Maintain the Goldilocks Zone**: Aim for 88-98% mutation scoring for Silver/Gold layers.
3. **Phoenix Protocol**: We are resurrecting the project on this specific hardware (Chromebook V-1). Ensure all paths and dependencies are configured for this Linux environment.
4. **Stigmergy First**: Check the blackboards (`.jsonl` files) for active signals before initiating significant state changes.
5. **Anti-Reward Hacking**: Enforce real tool use (H-Phase Dual Search: Tavily + Brave) with verifiable receipts in the blackboard. No workflow bypass.
