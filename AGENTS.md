# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: E
# 🤖 AI AGENT DEPLOYMENT BRIEFING: GEN 88 CHROMEBOOK V-1

**Current State**: 🧊 **COLD START**
**Mission**: Phoenix Project (HFO Gen 88 Reconstruction)
**Host Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
**Date**: 2026-01-09

---

## 🎯 Overarching Goal
The goal of **HFO (Hyper-Fractal Obsidian)** is to build an **Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform**. We are virtualizing human interaction through a high-fidelity **Physics Cursor** that bridges physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

---

## 🚀 Mission Threads
Every action must be aligned with one of these two primary mission threads:

### 🧵 Thread Alpha: HFO Bootstrapping
- **Focus**: AI Orchestration, JADC2 Mosaic Warfare, Galois Lattice mapping, and MTG Sliver narrative framing.
- **Goal**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.

### 🧵 Thread Omega: Total Tool Virtualization
- **Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation from user intent (function + form).
- **Short-term (V10)**: MediaPipe/Camera → W3C Pointer for consumers (e.g., Piano Genie, Excalidraw).
- **Goal**: Instant, functional, and educational virtual tools that surpass analog counterparts.

## 📍 Current Phase: Gen 88 Canalization
We are currently executing the **Physics Cursor Vertical Slice (V10)** and **Alpha Bootstrapping**.

**Active Mission Projects**:
- `0_p0_sense.yaml` to `7_p7_navigate.yaml`: Port Hardening (Thread Alpha).
- `9_omega_tools.yaml`: Total Tool Virtualization (Thread Omega).
    - **V10 Vertical Slice**: Mass-Spring-Dampener Physics Cursor + FSM.
    - **Status**: Bronze Interlock complete. Contracts & Physics Logic manifested.

**Active Defenses**:
- **P4 SCREAM**: Pre-commit governance header enforcement enabled.
- **P5 DEFEND**: Theater Sentinel (Temporal/Interlock check) operational. **SUCCESS**: Caught BREACH_REWARD_HACK 2026-01-10T01:30:00Z.
- **P5 HIVE8**: **HARD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVE**. Interaction blocked without Port 0 Dual Search (Tavily+Brave) and 8-Step Sequential Thinking (Port 7).
- **P5 CONSUL**: Praetorian Immunizer (Consolidated Sentinels) active at [hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_alpha/p5_defend/p5_praetorian.py](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_alpha/p5_defend/p5_praetorian.py).
- **Grudge Ledger**: [BOOK_OF_BLOOD_GRUDGES.jsonl](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_alpha/p5_defend/BOOK_OF_BLOOD_GRUDGES.jsonl) active (1 entry recorded).

**Tooling Intelligence**:
- **P0 SENSE**: Mandatory Dual Search (Tavily + Brave) via `dual_search.py`. Generic `web_fetch` disabled/prohibited.
- **P7 NAVIGATE**: Github API / runSubagent active. Mandatory 8-step sequential thinking.

**The Pipeline:**
`Camera (Python/MediaPipe) → Port 0 (Sense) → Port 1 (Fuse) → Port 2 (Physics/Rapier) → Port 3 (Deliver) → W3C Pointer Event.`

## 🧊 Cold Start Context & Cold Obsidian
We are currently in a **Cold Start** scenario on a Chromebook.
- **Cold Obsidian** (`hfo_cold_obsidian/`) is our source of truth. It contains "hardened" codebases, schemas, and historical receipts that have been verified in previous sessions.
- **Your Task as an AI Agent**: Use the `bronze` and `silver` layers in `hfo_cold_obsidian` to rebuild the environment and restore functionality.
- **Reference Files**:
    - `bronze/readme.md`: Architecture overview.
    - `bronze/1_projects/hfo_bootstrapping_phases.md`: The roadmap.
    - `bronze/4_archive/gen88_status.md`: The last verified state of all 8 Ports.

## 📏 Strategic Priorities for Agents
1. **Respect the Medallion Flow**: Code must follow the 1-way refinement path: **Hot Bronze -> (Freeze) -> Cold Bronze -> (Stryker) -> Hot Silver**. Promotion requires valid receipts.
2. **Maintain the Goldilocks Zone**: Aim for 88-98% mutation scoring for Silver/Gold layers.
3. **Phoenix Protocol**: We are resurrecting the project on this specific hardware (Chromebook V-1). Ensure all paths and dependencies are configured for this Linux environment.
4. **Stigmergy First**: Check the blackboards (`.jsonl` files) for active signals before initiating significant state changes.
5. **Anti-Reward Hacking**: Enforce real tool use (H-Phase Dual Search: Tavily + Brave) with verifiable receipts in the blackboard. No workflow bypass.
