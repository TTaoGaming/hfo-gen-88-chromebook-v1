# 🤖 AI AGENT DEPLOYMENT BRIEFING: GEN 88 CHROMEBOOK V-1

**Current State**: 🧊 **COLD START**
**Mission**: Phoenix Project (HFO Gen 88 Reconstruction)
**Host Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
**Date**: 2026-01-09

---

## 🎯 Overarching Goal
The goal of **HFO (Hyper-Fractal Obsidian)** is to build an **Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform**. We are virtualizing human interaction through a high-fidelity **Physics Cursor** that bridges physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

### Core Components
- **8 Legendary Commanders (Ports 0-7)**: Specialized AI nodes using JADC2 doctrine.
- **Mosaic Warfare**: Disaggregated, composable effects via AI Stigmergy.
- **Medallion Flow**: Refinement from Bronze (unstable) to HFO (MAP-ELITE optimized).

---

## 📍 Current Phase: Gen 88 Canalization
We are currently executing the **Physics Cursor Vertical Slice (V10)**.

**The Pipeline:**
`Camera (Python/MediaPipe) → Port 0 (Sense) → Port 1 (Fuse) → Port 2 (Physics/Rapier) → Port 3 (Deliver) → W3C Pointer Event.`

## 🧊 Cold Start Context & Cold Obsidian
We are currently in a **Cold Start** scenario on a Chromebook.
- **Cold Obsidian** (`hfo_cold_obsidian/`) is our source of truth. It contains "hardened" codebases, schemas, and historical receipts that have been verified in previous sessions.
- **Your Task as an AI Agent**: Use the `bronze` and `silver` layers in `hfo_cold_obsidian` to rebuild the environment and restore functionality.
- **Reference Files**:
    - `bronze/readme.md`: Architecture overview.
    - `bronze/1_projects/hfo_bootstrapping_phases.md`: The roadmap.
    - `bronze/4_archive/gen88_status.md`: The last verified state of all 8 Ports.

## 🧠 Strategic Priorities for Agents
1. **Respect the Medallion Flow**: Code must be tested and "cooled" in Bronze before moving to Silver.
2. **Maintain the Goldilocks Zone**: Aim for 88-98% mutation scoring.
3. **Phoenix Protocol**: We are resurrecting the project on this specific hardware (Chromebook V-1). Ensure all paths and dependencies are configured for this Linux environment.
4. **Stigmergy First**: Check the blackboards (`.jsonl` files) for active signals before initiating significant state changes.
