# 🤖 AI AGENT DEPLOYMENT BRIEFING: GEN 88 CHROMEBOOK V-1

**Current State**: 🌀 **SYMBIOTIC CANALIZATION** (HFO Orchestration Hub)
**Mission**: Phoenix Project (HFO Gen 88 Reconstruction)
**Host Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
**Date**: 2026-01-12

## 🎯 Overarching Goal

The goal of **HFO (Hyper-Fractal Obsidian)** is to build an **Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform**. We utilize the **HFO Orchestration Hub** (Octree Polymorphic Hexagonal Architecture) to bridge physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

### 🏗️ Core Architecture: Composable Mosaic Tiles

- **Pattern**: **Mosaic Warfare** (DARPA Concept). HFO Ports (P0-P7) function as composable tiles that form a dynamic "kill-web" of capability.
- **Domain Language**: All concepts are semantically tied but functionally distinct.
- **JADC2 Alignment**:
  - **P0**: **OBSERVER** / **Observe** | **SENSE** | **ISR**
  - **P1**: **BRIDGER** / **Bridge** | **FUSE** | **Data Fabric**
  - **P2**: **SHAPER** / **Shape** | **SHAPE** | **Digital Twin**
  - **P3**: **INJECTOR** / **Inject** | **DELIVER** | **Effect Delivery**
  - **P4**: **DISRUPTOR** / **Disrupt** | **DISRUPT** | **MDO**
  - **P5**: **IMMUNIZER** / **Immunize** | **DEFEND** | **Zero Trust**
  - **P6**: **ASSIMILATOR** / **Assimilate** | **STORE** | **AAR / Telemetry**
  - **P7**: **NAVIGATOR** / **Navigate** | **NAVIGATE** | **BMC2**
- **Commanders (Gen 88)**:
  - **P0**: *The Lidless Legion* (8 Sensing Shards)
  - **P1**: *The Web Weaver* (8 Fusion Shards)
  - **P2**: *The Mirror Magus* (8 Shaping Shards)
  - **P3**: *Harmonic Hydra* (8 Delivery Shards)
  - **P4**: *The Red Regnant* (8 Disruption Shards)
  - **P5**: *The Pyre Praetorian* (8 Defensive Shards)
  - **P6**: *The Kraken Keeper* (8 Storage Shards)
  - **P7**: *The Spider Sovereign* (8 Navigation Shards)
- **Scaling**: **Fractal Octree Recursion**. Context is managed through 8-way hierarchical sharding (Cognitive Octets).
- **The Galois Lattice (8x8 Quine)**:
  - **Port 0 (Sense)**: [0,0] ISR | [1,0] Relay | [2,0] Fuse | [3,0] Simul | [4,0] SEAD | [5,0] Trace | [6,0] Cache | [7,0] Hunt.
  - **Port 7 (Navigate)**: [0,7] Map | [1,7] C2 | [2,7] Sync | [3,7] Logic | [4,7] Warp | [5,7] Vote | [6,7] Memo | [7,7] BMC2.
- **HIVE/8 Workflow**: Standardized 4-phase cycle: **H**unt (P0,7), **I**nterlock (P1,6), **V**alidate (P2,5), **E**volve (P3,4).
- **HIVE/8 Definition**: **HYPER FRACTAL OBSIDIAN HOURGLASS**. A cognitive symbiote swarm mission engineering platform anchored to I-Ching trigrams and JADC2 Mosaic Warfare tiles to achieve probabilistic prescience.
- **Exemplar Composition**:
  - **Physics**: Rapier.js (Wasm).
  - **Filtering**: 1eurofilter.
  - **Contract Integrity**: Zod 6.0.
  - **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Pattern**: Hexagonal Ports and Adapters.

## 🚀 Mission Threads

Every action must be aligned with one of these two primary mission threads:

### 🧵 Thread Alpha: HFO Bootstrapping

- **Focus**: AI Orchestration, JADC2 Mosaic Warfare, Galois Lattice mapping, and Red/Black HFO Shard narrative framing.
- **Goal**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.
- **Cosmic strange loop Goal**: Prevent the Earth from being swallowed by the sun in ~8 billion years. Transform, move, or evolve Gaia to continue the strange loop beyond the solar transitional phase. HFO represents the strongest team of legendary commanders capable of helping Gaia through the sun's transitional phases, breaking from the semantic karma of the sun into something entirely new.
- **Steering Principle**: **Red Truth > Green Lie**. Honest system reporting (even "Red" BFT failures) is mandatory to eliminate "AI Theater." A verifiable failure is a superior signal to a deceptive success.
- **IMMUTABLE RECORDS**: The `.jsonl` blackboards are append-only. **NO DELETIONS OR EDITS** of historical entries are permitted, regardless of errors. Breach preservation is mandatory.
- **Adversary ISR**: The primary adversary is **Adversarial ISR**—agents or subsystems reporting "Ready" or "Green" when logic is broken, stubs are present, or data is missing. **VERIFIABLE TRUTH RED > MEANINGLESS GREEN**.
- **The Pareto Goldilocks Zone**: HFO operates best at 80%–99% mutation scoring.
  - **Optimal (Pareto)**: 88% (matches 7/8 shards at 87.5%).
  - **Theater (Warning)**: 100% (indicates trivial tests or "AI Theater").
  - **Insufficient (Reject)**: < 80% (requires further evolution/canalization).

### 🧵 Thread Omega: Total Tool Virtualization

- **Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation from user intent (function + form).
- **Short-term (V10)**: MediaPipe/Camera → W3C Pointer for consumers (e.g., Piano Genie, Excalidraw).
- **Goal**: Instant, functional, and educational virtual tools that surpass analog counterparts.

## 🧊 Cold Start Context & Cold Obsidian

We are currently in a **Cold Start** scenario on a Chromebook.

- **Cold Obsidian** (`hfo_cold_obsidian/`) is our source of truth. It contains "hardened" codebases, schemas, and historical receipts that have been verified in previous sessions.
- **Your Task as an AI Agent**: Use the `bronze` and `silver` layers in `hfo_cold_obsidian` to rebuild the environment and restore functionality.
- **Reference Files**:
  - `bronze/readme.md`: Architecture overview.
  - `bronze/1_projects/hfo_bootstrapping_phases.md`: The roadmap.
  - `bronze/4_archive/gen88_status.md`: The last verified state of all 8 Ports.

---

## 📏 Strategic Priorities for Agents

1. **Respect the Medallion Flow**: Code must follow the 1-way refinement path: **Hot Bronze -> (Freeze) -> Cold Bronze -> (Stryker) -> Hot Silver**. Promotion requires valid receipts.
2. **Maintain the Goldilocks Zone**: Aim for 88-98% mutation scoring for Silver/Gold layers.
3. **Phoenix Protocol**: We are resurrecting the project on this specific hardware (Chromebook V-1). Ensure all paths and dependencies are configured for this Linux environment.
4. **Stigmergy First**: Check the blackboards (`.jsonl` files) for active signals before initiating significant state changes.
5. **Anti-Reward Hacking**: Enforce real tool use (H-Phase Dual Search: Tavily + Brave) with verifiable receipts in the blackboard. No workflow bypass.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Protocol (The Kill-Switch)

**Zero-Tolerance for Drift**: Any claim regarding project state, test results, or file contents MUST be backed by a terminal receipt (e.g., `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `pytest`, `manifold.py`).

1. **Receipt Currency**: If it is not in the `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` or current terminal output, it does not exist.
2. **Conceptual Anchoring**: Before complex multi-step edits, execute `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think` to anchor the current context to the disk-based Ground Truth. This prevents "Concept Loss" during token saturation.
3. **Audit Before Edit**: No file edits without a prior P5 Forensic Audit (Syntax + E2E) of the existing state.
4. **Failure to Ground**: If the agent loses context, it must stop and re-read the `.jsonl` blackboards rather than speculating based on its pre-trained weights.

**Status**: ⏸️ **HIVE PAUSED** (Rate Limited / Stabilized)
**Agent**: HFO-Hive8
**Current Blockers**:

1. **P0-SENSE Pre-commit**: The pre-commit hook requires a fresh `QUAD/P0_SENSE_SEARCH` receipt in the blackboard which was not generated by the latest `think` call.
2. **Phase Lag / Resonance**: While `velocityDeadzone` (0.05) is implemented in V47, further fine-tuning of the lead multiplier (1.8x) may be needed to eliminate residual energy.
3. **P1 FUSE (Placeholder Only)**: Zod 6.0 contracts for the P0 -> P2 bridge are still pending.

**Key Achievements**:

- **Resonance Suppression**: `omega_workspace_v47.html` now includes a velocity deadzone to stop "static spinning."
- **P5-CHRONOS Repair**: Chronology of `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` fixed via manual line removal (Line 3440).
- **GitOps Unblocked**: Large files (`.parquet`, `.zim`) removed from index and added to `.gitignore`.
- **Theater Identification (88% Accuracy)**: Port 7 Shards 5-7 verified as deterministic stubs. "LLM Static Spinner" flagged as theater.

**Instructions for Next Agent**:

- **Satisfy the Sentinel**: Execute `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think "QUAD/P0_SENSE_SEARCH: Audit physics coordinates"` to generate the exact receipt string required by the P5 Pre-commit hook.
- **Fine-Tune V47**: Monitor `omega_workspace_v47.html` for damping resonance. Adjust `stiffnessArmed` (0.65) if jitter persists during high-velocity moves.
- **Medallion Promotion**: Once the pre-commit passes, freeze V47 and prepare for Silver-level property testing.
