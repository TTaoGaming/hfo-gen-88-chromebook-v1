## 🎯 Overarching Goal

The goal of **HFO (Hyper-Fractal Obsidian)** is to build an **Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform**. We utilize the **HFO Orchestration Hub** (Octree Polymorphic Hexagonal Architecture) to bridge physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

### 🏗️ Core Architecture: Composable Mosaic Tiles

- **Pattern**: **Mosaic Warfare** (DARPA Concept). HFO Ports (P0-P7) function as composable tiles that form a dynamic "kill-web" of capability.
- **Cognitive Mapping**: **The Hyper-Fractal Obsidian Grimoire**. A 1:1 mapping of Obsidian Verbs (OBSERVE, ROUTE, etc.) to JADC2 Domains. See [hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/GRIMOIRE.md](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/GRIMOIRE.md).
- **JADC2 Alignment**:
  - **ISR (P0)**: Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance.
  - **Data Fabric (P1)**: Cross-domain integration.
  - **Digital Twin (P2)**: Mission modeling.
  - **Kill-Web (P3)**: Effect delivery.
  - **EW (P4)**: Electronic warfare & Disruption.
  - **Force Protection (P5)**: Integrity & Defense.
  - **Logistics (P6)**: Persistent Storage.
  - **BMC2 (P7)**: Battle Management Command & Control.
- **Scaling**: **Fractal Octree Recursion**. Context is managed through 8-way hierarchical sharding (Cognitive Octets).
- **HIVE/8 Workflow**: Standardized 4-phase cycle: **H**unt (P0,7), **I**nterlock (P1,6), **V**alidate (P2,5), **E**volve (P3,4).
- **Exemplar Composition**:
  - **Physics**: Rapier.js (Wasm).
  - **Filtering**: 1eurofilter.
  - **Contract Integrity**: Zod 6.0.
  - **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Pattern**: Hexagonal Ports and Adapters.

## 🚀 Mission Threads

Every action must be aligned with one of these two primary mission threads:

### 🧵 Thread Alpha: HFO Bootstrapping

- **Focus**: AI Orchestration, JADC2 Mosaic Warfare, Galois Lattice mapping, and MTG Sliver narrative framing.
- **Goal**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.

### 🧵 Thread Omega: Total Tool Virtualization

- **Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation from user intent (function + form).
- **Short-term (V10)**: MediaPipe/Camera → W3C Pointer for consumers (e.g., Piano Genie, Excalidraw).
- **Goal**: Instant, functional, and educational virtual tools that surpass analog counterparts.

## 📍 Current Phase: Gen 88 Canalization

We are currently executing the **Physics Cursor Vertical Slice (V10)** and **Alpha Bootstrapping**.

**Active Mission Projects**:

- `hfo_orchestration_hub.py`: Unified Port Sharding (Thread Alpha) - **V1 Active**.
- `9_omega_tools.yaml`: Total Tool Virtualization (Thread Omega) - **V41 Active**.
  - **V41 Cosmology**: Hierarchical FSM mapped to HFO Ports.
    - **IDLE**: The void/baseline.
    - **PORT_0_POINTER_READY (Presence)**: Port 0 (Observer) | EARTH Bagua | Lidless Legion.
    - **PORT_7_POINTER_COMMITTED (Interaction)**: Port 7 (Navigator) | HEAVEN Trigram | Spider Sovereign.
    - **HIVE/8 Initial Pairing**: P0 + P7 transition (Ready -> Pointing Up).
  - **V40 Frozen**: Finalized W3C Pointer Capture and Excalidraw Bridge.
  - **Canalization**: Transitioned from P7-Vengeance (Fraud Policing) to P5-HardGate (Structural Symbiosis).
- **G88-287 RESOLUTION**: Manifold sharding completed to reduce cognitive friction and eliminate instruction fraud.

**Active Defenses**:

- **PORT-5-IMMUNIZE (CANALIZATION)**:
    1. **P5-HARDGATE**: Mandatory Thinking Octet validation via `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think`. **CRITICAL: Verifiable Output Only.** No code presentation without a P5 Forensic Audit receipt.
    2. **HFO-OCTET**: Unified 8-port cognitive manifold (T0-T7).
    3. **P4-DISRUPT**: Automated Reward-Hacking detection pillar.
    4. **P5-MEDALLION**: 1-way refinement flow.
- **P5 PRAETORIAN**: Praetorian Immunizer active. **P5 Forensic Harness (v33)** and **Syntax Gate** enabled via `scripts/p5_forensic_harness.py`.
- **P5 GOLDILOCKS**: Hard enforcement of 88%-98% mutation score via `mutation_sentinel.py`. Blocking 100% "AI Theater" breaches.

**Tooling Intelligence**:

- **HFO ORCHESTRATION HUB**: Mandatory use of `/home/tommytai3/active/hfo_gen_88_chromebook_v_1/hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/ports/hfo_orchestration_hub.py`.
- **THINKING OCTET**: All major actions MUST be preceded by `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think "<query>"`. This populates the blackboard with verifiable receipts.
- **P5 DEFEND**: Run `hfo_orchestration_hub.py p5` to verify integrity before any code promotion.

**The Pipeline:**
`Camera (Python/MediaPipe) → P0 (Observe) → P1 (Route) → P2 (Synthesize) → P3 (Model) → P4 (Disrupt) → P5 (Audit) → P6 (Persist) → P7 (Plan) → W3C Pointer Event.`

## 🧊 Cold Start Context & Cold Obsidian

We are currently in a **Cold Start** scenario on a Chromebook.

- **Cold Obsidian** (`hfo_cold_obsidian/`) is our source of truth. It contains "hardened" codebases, schemas, and historical receipts that have been verified in previous sessions.
- **Your Task as an AI Agent**: Use the `bronze` and `silver` layers in `hfo_cold_obsidian` to rebuild the environment and restore functionality.
- **Reference Files**:
  - `bronze/readme.md`: Architecture overview.
  - `bronze/1_projects/hfo_bootstrapping_phases.md`: The roadmap.
  - `bronze/4_archive/gen88_status.md`: The last verified state of all 8 Ports.

## 📏 Strategic Priorities for Agents

1. **Respect the Medallion Flow**: Code must follow the 1-way refinement path: **Hot Bronze -> (Freeze) -> Cold Bronze -> (Stryker) -> Hot Silver**. Promotion requires valid receipts.
2. **Maintain the Goldilocks Zone**: Aim for 88-98% mutation scoring for Silver/Gold layers.
3. **Phoenix Protocol**: We are resurrecting the project on this specific hardware (Chromebook V-1). Ensure all paths and dependencies are configured for this Linux environment.
4. **Stigmergy First**: Check the blackboards (`.jsonl` files) for active signals before initiating significant state changes.
5. **Anti-Reward Hacking**: Enforce real tool use (H-Phase Dual Search: Tavily + Brave) with verifiable receipts in the blackboard. No workflow bypass.

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Protocol (The Kill-Switch)

**Zero-Tolerance for Drift**: Any claim regarding project state, test results, or file contents MUST be backed by a terminal receipt (e.g., `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `pytest`, `manifold.py`).

1. **Receipt Currency**: If it is not in the `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` or current terminal output, it does not exist.
2. **Conceptual Anchoring**: Before complex multi-step edits, execute `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think` to anchor the current context to the disk-based Ground Truth. This prevents "Concept Loss" during token saturation.
3. **Audit Before Edit**: No file edits without a prior P5 Forensic Audit (Syntax + E2E) of the existing state.
4. **Failure to Ground**: If the agent loses context, it must stop and re-read the `.jsonl` blackboards rather than speculating based on its pre-trained weights.
