# 🕳️ State-Action Space Gap Analysis: V20 Bridge

## 📍 Current State (V20: "The Bridged Dualist")
- **Port 0 (SENSE)**: 2-Hand Index Tip tracking (1280x720, 30fps).
- **Port 1 (FUSE)**: Zod 6.0 Contract Enforcement + CloudEvent 1.0 Telemetry.
- **Port 2 (SHAPE)**: Dual-ensemble Matter.js (2D) mass-spring mechanics.
- **Port 3 (DELIVER)**: UI Dashboard with validated telemetry cards.

## 🎯 Ideal State (Total Tool Virtualization)
- **Full Kinematics**: 21-point hand tracking per hand (all fingers dynamic).
- **W3C Seamlessness**: Injection of trusted PointerEvents into third-party substrates (Excalidraw, etc.).
- **Rapier WASM**: 3D physics with robust collision and constraint solvers.
- **FSM Orchestration**: Intelligent pointer state management (Acquiring -> Committed -> Manipulating).

## 📊 Gap Matrix (8x8 Galois Lattice)

| Feature              | V20 Status      | Gap                           | Priority |
| :------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------- | :------- |
| Fingertip Physics    | Index Only      | 4/5 Fingers missing           | HIGH     |
| Event Injection      | Simulation Only | No W3C Dispatch               | CRITICAL |
| Dimensionality       | 2D (Matter.js)  | Lacks Z-depth physics         | MEDIUM   |
| Identity Persistence | Greedy Match    | Needs Hungarian Algorithm     | LOW      |
| Contract Depth       | Basic HandState | Needs Full Gesture Vocabulary | MEDIUM   |
| Latency              | ~45ms           | Needs <20ms for "Touch" feel  | HIGH     |

## 🚀 Convergence Plan
1. **P3-DELIVER**: Implement the Pointer FSM (Idle/Down/Move/Up).
2. **P2-SHAPE**: Transition to Rapier.js for 3D spatial awareness.
3. **P0-SENSE**: Expand tracking to all 10 fingertips.
4. **P1-FUSE**: Define Zod schemas for complex gestures (Pinch-to-Scale, Scroll).
