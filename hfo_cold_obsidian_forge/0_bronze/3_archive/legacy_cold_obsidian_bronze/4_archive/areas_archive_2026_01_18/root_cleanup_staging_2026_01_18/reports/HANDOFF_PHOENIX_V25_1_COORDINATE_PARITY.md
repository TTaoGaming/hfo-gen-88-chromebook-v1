# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: V

# 🛰️ Handoff Briefing: [2026-01-15 18:20 UTC]

**Status**: 🚀 **HIVE ACTIVE** (Mission Omega: v25.1 Coordinate Parity)
**Agent**: HFO-Hive8
**Current Blockers**:

1. **Vertical Interaction Offset**: In [hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v24_21.html](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v24_21.html), the synthetic `PointerEvents` land approximately 20-40px above the visual flame cursor.
2. **Excalidraw UI Mapping**: While the iframe is centered within the parity box, the inner event translation needs final validation after the vertical offset is fixed.

**Key Achievements**:

- **P5 Forensic Rebirth**: Successfully reconciled the `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` using `scripts/resign_v2.py`. Fixed 16+ temporal reversals and re-signed the cryptochain. Aggregate status: **PASS**.
- **Substrate Parity Alignment**: Established a unified "Parity Box" in [v24_21.html](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v24_21.html) that centers Babylon, Pixi, and Excalidraw layers over the letterboxed video feed.
- **Skeletal Aesthetics**: Decoupled the hand landmarks from the FSM state; they now appear as "bone-white" transparent lines in all tracking states (IDLE/READY/COMMIT).
- **Tool Discovery**: Verified `dispatchToHydraHydrant` successfully traverses the DOM to find interactive parents (buttons/icons) within the Excalidraw substrate.

**Instructions for Next Agent**:

- **Calibrate Offset**: Adjust the vertical transformation in the pointer injection loop. The `offsetY` calculated in `resizeCanvas()` is active, but the scaling between the video coordinate space and the Babylon projection may require a final delta constant.
- **Verify Pulse Clicks**: Test the "Pulse" click sequence (10ms settle buffer) on the Excalidraw "Rectangle" or "Draw" buttons to ensure state-priming is working on this hardware.
- **Stabilization Lock**: Once interaction is 1:1 with the flame, freeze the build as **V25.1** and prepare for Silver-layer promotion.
