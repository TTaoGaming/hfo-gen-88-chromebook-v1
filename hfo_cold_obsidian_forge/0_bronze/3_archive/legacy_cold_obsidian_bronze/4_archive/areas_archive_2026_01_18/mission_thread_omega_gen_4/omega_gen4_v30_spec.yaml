# OMEGA GEN 4 V30.0 SPECIFICATION
# Focus: User Onboarding, FSM Hardening (Anti-Midas), and Visual Feedback

mission_objectives:
  - id: USER_ONBOARDING
    status: PLANNED
    description: "Implement a guided onboarding sequence to teach the state flow: READY <-> IDLE and READY -> COMMIT -> IDLE."

  - id: FSM_HARDENING_ANTI_MIDAS
    status: PLANNED
    description: "Lock COMMIT state once entered. Interaction remains 'sticky' regardless of gesture changes until the user returns to IDLE (palm away)."

  - id: VISUAL_FEEDBACK_MAPPING
    status: PLANNED
    description: "Map FSM states to specific visual substrates: IDLE (Skeleton), READY (Amber Fire), COMMIT (Cyan Fire)."

  - id: PALM_DRAIN_HYSTERESIS
    status: PLANNED
    description: "Implement dwell leaky bucket hysteresis for Palm-to-Camera (READY) and Palm-Away (IDLE) transitions."

    steps:
      - pulse: "Skeleton Only (IDLE)"
      - trigger: "Palm Towards Camera + Dwell"
      - result: "Amber Pointer (READY)"
      - trigger: "High Confidence Gesture + Dwell"
      - result: "Cyan Pointer (COMMIT)"
      - release: "Palm Away + Dwell"
      - reset: "Back to IDLE"

  - id: PALM_CONE_PRESETS
    description: "Provide 2 standard presets (Tight/Loose) for palm angle tolerances with Developer fine-tuning override."

  - id: STAMP_COMMIT_LOCK
    description: "Once COMMIT is triggered, the index fingertip tracking is locked for document interaction until the palm-away drainage completes."
