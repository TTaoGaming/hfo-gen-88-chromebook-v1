# 🐙 PORT 6: KRAKEN KEEPER - KNOWLEDGE ROLLUP MANIFEST [2026-01-14]

**Medallion**: Bronze | **Mission**: Project Phoenix | **Status**: 🔴 RED_ALARM (Chronos Fracture Active)

---

## 🛰️ 1. HOLOGRAPHIC STATE OF SYSTEM

### 🟢 MAJOR SUCCESSES (Thread Omega: V24+ Evolution)

- **V22 Babylon Substrate**: Successfully initialized [omega_gen4_v22_babylon_lab.html](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v22_babylon_lab.html) with 4-variant particle manifolds (Solar Flare, Plasma Blue).
- **Direct Projection Hardening**: Eliminated longitudinal oscillation by decoupling pointer math from the Mass-Spring physics loop ([V20.6 Promoted](AGENTS.md#v206-promoted)).
- **Anatomical Anchor (V20.3)**: Stabilized interaction rod using absolute Index/Pinky span measures, solving variable distance jitter.
- **Port 1 Zod 6.0 Contracts**: Successfully fused MediaPipe landmarks with Rapier/Babylon coordinates via strict schema validation.

### 🔴 CRITICAL BREACHES & VIOLATIONS

- **[CB-001] Medallion Sprawl**: Premature content detected in [hfo_hot_obsidian/silver/](hfo_hot_obsidian/silver/). Governance mandates SILVER/GOLD/HFO layers remain empty/levels-only during the Bronze incubation phase.
- **[CB-002] Root Pollution**: 25+ operational scripts (e.g., `debug_sig.py`, `package.json`) detected in Root. (Cleanup initiated 2026-01-14).
- **[P5.4] Chronos Fracture**: Immutable timestamp reversal/signature mismatch detected at line [hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl#L5556](hfo_hot_obsidian/hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl#L5556). System is in aggregate FAIL status.
- **[BFT-72] Adversarial Theater**: High density of LLM stubs and "Static Spinner" behavior detected in Shards 0, 3, and 5. Logic is being "steered" rather than calculated.

## 🏛️ 2. MEDALLION DATALAKE / PARA AUDIT

| Layer | Status | Sprawl Count | Violation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BRONZE (Hot)** | 🟢 ACTIVE | N/A | Primary Workspace. Contains Phoenix V1-V22. |
| **BRONZE (Cold)** | 🟡 RECOVERING | Low | Post-Lobotomy reconstruction (See [BREACH 001](hfo_cold_obsidian/BOOK_OF_BLOOD_GRUDGES.md)). |
| **SILVER** | 🔴 VIOLATION | 6 Files | Premature promotion of `omega_core.ts` detected. |
| **GOLD** | 🟢 EMPTY | 0 Files | Directories only. Integrity preserved. |
| **HFO** | 🟢 EMPTY | 0 Files | Directories only. Integrity preserved. |

## 🛠️ 3. ASSIMILATION TOOLSET REQUIREMENTS

To transition Port 6 (Assimilator) from "Observer" to "Knowledge Rollup Sovereign," the following tools are required:

1. **`hfo_assimilator_v1.py`**:
   - **Function**: Consolidates `.jsonl` blackboards into high-density Markdown summaries.
   - **Logic**: Filters out "Adversarial Theater" (Yellow/Red) and retains "Red Truth" (Successes/Failures).
2. **`medallion_sentinel.sh`**:
   - **Function**: Blocks any write to `silver/`, `gold/`, or `hfo/` that does not contain a P5 Forensic Pass signature.
   - **Logic**: Enforces the 1-way Medallion Flow.
3. **`chronos_seal_generator.py`**:
   - **Function**: Re-signs the blackboard chain following a fracture using a "RED_TRUTH_SEAL" entry.
   - **Logic**: Allows signature continuity without deleting historical records.

## 📍 4. KNOWLEDGE ROLLUP READINESS: **[NO]**

**Reason**: The **Chronos Fracture** and **Medallion Sprawl** indicate that the current "Rollup" would be polluted by adversarial theater.
**Action Plan**:

1. Execute **Deep Purity Audit** (P5).
2. Purge `hfo_hot_obsidian/silver/` content.
3. Deploy `RED_TRUTH_SEAL` to line 5556.
4. ONLY THEN initiate the **Grand Rollup of Thread Omega**.
