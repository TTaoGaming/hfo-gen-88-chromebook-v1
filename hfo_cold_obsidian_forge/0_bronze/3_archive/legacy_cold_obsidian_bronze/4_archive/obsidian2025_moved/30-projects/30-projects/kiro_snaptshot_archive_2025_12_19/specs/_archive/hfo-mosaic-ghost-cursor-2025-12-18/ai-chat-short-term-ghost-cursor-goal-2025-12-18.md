Phase 0 (now): prove a “medical-grade feel” input layer, not a medical device

Deliverable: Ghost Cursor SDK with:

1–2 pointers, clutch, dwell/hold click, drag, scroll

full telemetry (false click rate, miss rate, p95 latency, occlusion recovery)
This is your reusable asset across all AoAs.
Phase 1 (fastest credible medical demo): A2 “skills trainer”

Build 2–3 canonical tasks that map cleanly to pointer streams:

bimanual coordination (two cursors)

precision path following (tremor/jitter scoring)

timed target acquisition (reaction + stability)
Rationale: published work supports low-cost gesture devices in surgical psychomotor training contexts, and the economics of simulation labs make “cheaper training” a real buyer pain.

Phase 2 (robustness leap): add thermal + quorum gating

Use thermal as a veto/confirm channel (independent modality) and document measurable reductions in false activations; thermal phone add-ons exist.

Only after you can show an evidence delta should you pay the complexity tax.

Phase 3 (enterprise): A1 OR image control

Research exists across decades (e.g., sterile gesture navigation of radiology images; OR usability studies; surveys of non-contact OR image control).

But success depends more on integration + procurement than on gesture recognition alone.
