# HFO Evolution Timeline - LLM Context

> This is a portable memory bank for AI agents. It contains 6,423 documents spanning the HFO project from pre-HFO origins through Generation 84.

## What is HFO?

HFO (Human-First Ontology) is a personal knowledge management and AI collaboration system developed by ttao (the user). It evolved through 84+ generations from September 2025 to December 2025, with pre-HFO work in HOPE, Tectangle, and Spatial eras.

## Core Concepts

### The Obsidian Spider
- Card 09 in the grimoire system
- "The Godhead. The Infinite. The Web that holds the stars."
- Represents the system's mythic identity
- Connected to Indra's Net, the Hourglass, and the Octet of Chants

### Zero Invention Principle
- Core HFO philosophy
- Build on what exists rather than inventing from scratch
- Prefer composition over creation

### Stigmergy
- Indirect coordination through environment modification
- Blackboards as shared state
- Agents leave traces for other agents

### Kraken Keeper
- Memory and knowledge management system
- Preserves Historical Buds across generations
- Enables AI cold-start recovery

### Grimoire Cards
- 54+ archetypal concept cards
- Each card represents a core system concept
- Examples: Obsidian Spider, Kraken Keeper, Swarmlord

### Historical Buds
- Preserved knowledge snapshots
- Each generation produces a "bud" of crystallized knowledge
- GEMs, QUINEs, HANDOFFs, BATONs

## Key File Types

- **HANDOFF**: Generation transition documents
- **QUINE**: Self-describing system documentation
- **GEM**: Core knowledge crystallization
- **BATON**: Knowledge transfer between sessions
- **BLACKBOARD**: Stigmergy state storage (JSONL)

## Timeline

| Period | Era/Gen | Key Events |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Jan-Aug 2025 | Pre-HFO | HOPE, Tectangle, Spatial foundations |
| Sep 2025 | Gen 1-31 | HFO birth, Zero Invention Principle |
| Oct 2025 | Gen 32-52 | Vector experiments |
| Oct-Nov 2025 | Gen 53-67 | Historical Buds consolidation |
| Nov-Dec 2025 | Gen 68-84 | Rapid iteration, Kraken Keeper |

## How to Use This Memory

### Search (FTS)
```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('hfo_memory.duckdb', read_only=True)
con.execute('LOAD fts')

results = con.execute("""
    SELECT filename, generation,
           fts_main_artifacts.match_bm25(id, 'your query') as score
    FROM artifacts WHERE score IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10
""").fetchall()
```

### Get Content
```python
result = con.execute("""
    SELECT content FROM artifacts 
    WHERE filename = 'card_09_obsidian_spider.md'
    LIMIT 1
""").fetchone()
```

## Search Status

- ✅ FTS (Full-Text Search) - Working
- 🔜 VSS (Vector Semantic Search) - Planned
- 🔜 GraphRAG (Entity Graph) - Planned
- 🔜 RRF (Rank Fusion) - Blocked on VSS+GraphRAG

## Important Notes

1. Always cite sources with generation and filename
2. Don't hallucinate - if not found, say so
3. Respect generation boundaries
4. Pre-HFO content has NULL generation values
5. Use era field to distinguish: hfo, hope, tectangle, spatial
