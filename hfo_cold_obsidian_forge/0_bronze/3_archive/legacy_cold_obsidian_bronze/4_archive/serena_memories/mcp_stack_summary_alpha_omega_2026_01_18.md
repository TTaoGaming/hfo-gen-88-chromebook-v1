Update 2026-01-18: Treat the partial AI summary in hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/1_projects/ai-chat-hfo-alpha-omega-summary-2026-1-18.md as later-phase targets after stabilization. Mark as future-phase goals (not yet implemented): MAP-Elites archive, tri-temporal hourglass (Past/Present/Future), per-target adapters, cross-origin postMessage bridging. Current grounding for Alpha/Omega remains in UNIFIED_MISSION_HISTORY.md and AGENTS.md. Handoff validation artifacts: receipts and baton logs are in hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/3_resources/receipts/ (hfo_mcp_gateway_receipts.jsonl, hfo_mcp_gateway_baton.jsonl).
