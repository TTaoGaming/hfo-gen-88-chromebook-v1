# Executive Summary (Payload)

## Snapshot

- ts_utc: 2026_01_29T214040Z
- scope: P4
- turn_id: 80271718a8314f45b18da07f9c9349f4
- preflight_receipt_id: 68779bd22ee1
- note: Restored explicit Confidence+BFT (LOW/MED/HIGH/BFT) doctrine section in v8.8 compendium; verified compendium gates green.

## Executive Summary

This payload is the canonical, durable artifact for this turn.
It is written before postflight, and it anchors stigmergy coordination.

## Objective

- Primary objective: Restored explicit Confidence+BFT (LOW/MED/HIGH/BFT) doctrine section in v8.8 compendium; verified compendium gates green.
- Success criteria:
  - Preflight receipt exists and is referenced here.
  - Payload artifacts exist (this markdown + JSON manifest).
  - Postflight closes with a receipt_id.
  - Final beat emits a payoff/handoff event + continuity is refreshed.

## Scope + Constraints

- Scope: P4
- Fail-closed: if any beat or event emission fails, stop.
- Blackboard must be pointer-blessed (no ad-hoc paths).

## Pointers (resolved)

- p3s_payload_root: hfo_hot_obsidian_forge/0_bronze/3_resources/p3s_payloads
- blackboard: hfo_hot_obsidian_forge/0_bronze/2_resources/blackboards/hot_obsidian_blackboard_v5.jsonl

## Plan (operator-facing)

1) Confirm preflight receipt_id
2) Review this payload for clarity and intent
3) Execute work (outside the payload artifact)
4) Close with postflight and payoff/handoff

## Risks / Notes

- If postflight fails, retries are bounded and the run is fail-closed.
- If blackboard is not writable, the run must fail-closed.

## Evidence (to be populated post-run)

- payload_md_sha256: (computed by wrapper)
- payload_json_sha256: (computed by wrapper)
- postflight_receipt_id: (written after postflight)
