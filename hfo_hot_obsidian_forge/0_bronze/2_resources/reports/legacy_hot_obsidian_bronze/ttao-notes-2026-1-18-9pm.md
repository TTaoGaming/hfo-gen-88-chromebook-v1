we need to formalize mission thread alpha to give me daily coaching lessons
tailored education on health, fitness, research, so that I can be the best I can be. I am being too slow on certain things and procrastination, I need a customized research and evidence driven coach. should be under port 7 navigator - spider sovereign at least one of his shards needs to be learning scaffolding web and cognitive frameworks, and a health and non dev aspect like physical and mental health, and strategies, to train my mind with the best research available, teach me coding as well, so a shard for general life a shard for education a shard for coding and dev ops i need multiple internal and external shards

I think you need to redo the ports starting with port 0. focus on the JADc2 domain and the legendary commander archetype does that give you enough grounding in their role and purpose and archetype? the commanders I have are the best team I can coneive of, the legendary Apex ensemble. please list all 8 of them form port 0 to port 7 and their jadc2 domain and their power word and write who you think they are and what they should eventually be able to do within my swarm? does your semantic  vector architecture allow you to see my 8 obsidian grounding conceptual incarnations?
