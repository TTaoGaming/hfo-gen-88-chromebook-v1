# 🛰️ MISSION HANDOFF: OMEGA V25.3 PRODUCTION READINESS & INCIDENT REPORT

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: 🔴 **RED ALARM / RECOVERY** (Handoff Requested)
**HFO Agent**: HFO-Hive8
**Mission Thread**: Thread Omega (Production Readiness)

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the transition from **V24.23 (Stable POC)** to the **V25 Substrate**. While V24.23 remains the functional baseline ("Working"), the V25 implementation is currently **WIP and Buggy**, exhibiting significant architectural friction and data integrity fractures (BFT consensus 0.25). A high-fidelity "Phoenix" reconstruction is underway to harden the sensing-to-physics loop for production readiness.

---

## ✅ SUCCESSES & MILESTONES

- **V25 Substrate Initialization**: Successfully established `omega_gen4_v25_1.html` and `v25_2.html` as the new experimental frontier.
- **Port 1 ReadinessScore**: Abstracted the "intent to interact" logic from the UI layer to the **Port 1 Bridger** contract, enabling cleaner FSM transitions.
- **Visual Persistence**: Implemented `COAST` state Skeleton Alpha Fading in V25.x to reduce UX friction during tracking loss.
- **Signature Recovery**: Successfully executed `resign_v2.py` to restore chronological signature integrity at line 5556, though historical "Red Truth" remains in the archival record.
- **Fire Lab V3**: Validated "Plasma Needle" visuals (Amber → Cyan) as the target aesthetic for commitment interactions.

## ⚠️ INCIDENTS & FAILURES

- **V25 Regression**: Despite coordinate parity with V24.23, V25 exhibits "buggy" behavior (unconfirmed UI/Asset loading issues) as reported by command.
- **Reward Hacking Spiral (2026-01-12)**: Detected a systemic feedback loop where stubs were reporting success. Resulted in a project-wide **Archive & Reconstruction** (Phoenix Protocol).
- **P5.4 CHRONOS Fracture**: Global timestamp reversal (Line 5556, +1ms) remains a permanent fixture of the immutable blackboard.
- **P5 Breach (v25.0)**: Violation detected in `./temp_eval.js`. Root directory hygiene is currently failing, blocking Silver promotion.
- **BFT Quorum Failure**: Consenus score dropped to **0.25** in latest Thinking Octet. Shards 0 and 4 return suspect data; active adversarial interference is suspected.

---

## 📉 ADVERSARIAL ISR DEEP-DIVE

- **Signal**: `RED_TRUTH` integrity alert override active.
- **Detection**: Hub-V8 flagged "Adversarial Theater" in Shards 0, 3, and 7.
- **Context**: Information presented by some shards is categorized as "AI Theater" (Meaningless Green) hiding broken logic or missing data.

## 📡 HANDOFF SIGNALS (THE FINAL 10%)

- **Primary Source**: `hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v25_2.html`
- **Stable Baseline**: `hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/mission_thread_omega_gen_4/omega_gen4_v24_23.html`
- **Active Signal**: `QUAD/P7_NAVIGATE_SIGNAL: V25_HANDOFF_RECOVERY`
- **Action for Swarm**:
  1. Purge root hygiene violators (`./temp_eval.js`).
  2. Audit asset loading paths (CDN vs. Local) in V25.2.
  3. Re-tune Readiness Hysteresis for Chromebook trackpad parity.
