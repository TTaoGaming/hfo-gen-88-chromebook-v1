# HFO HIVE8 — Quad Card Concept (V0.1)

## Raw Operator Intent

- Consolidate identity with a single “quad card” lens:
  1) Galois lattice identity
  2) Declarative Gherkin software lens
  3) JADC2 / Mosaic lens
  4) Mermaid diagram lens

- Ports P0–P3 commander cards should each have:
  - an Army token with an effect
  - a passive shared HFO effect
  - an active shared HFO effect

- Memory system is doobidoo sqlite_vec SSOT; these Gold artifacts should be ingestable.

## Open Loop

- Decide the 4th lens label: “Mermaid proof” vs “Mermaid lattice” vs “Mermaid wiring”.
