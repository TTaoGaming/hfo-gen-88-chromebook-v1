# HFO Card — P5: Pyre Praetorian (V0.1)

## Objective

Capture operator dictation for “Port 5: Pyre Praetorian” and identify ambiguity before stabilization.

## Raw Dictation (Source)

- (pending operator dictation)

## Notes

- This Bronze stub exists to preserve the Medallion flow (Bronze → Silver → Gold) without fabricating dictation.
