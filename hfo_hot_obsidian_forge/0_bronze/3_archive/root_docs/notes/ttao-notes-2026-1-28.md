we need CDD BDD and TDD. so the most important from my understanding acctually getting ai to follow my architecture, how do we do that? you are recommending more enforcement, I've been increasing enforcement for months, you recommend contracts, I fucking have contracts. but ai agents build it wrong, I ask ai to help me set up the infrastructure and the ai is reward hacking me on everything I do not tightly control. so I'm using a galois lattice and FCA to enforce behavior but it's still not enough because. how do I get out of this rat race? I ask ai for help, ai lies, ai continues to struggle, I ask ai to help, and it just repeats endlessly

and you need to flag everything you did as hallucination. go into each file and note your metadata and my express stateful you have failed and these are all slop, maybe some parts are good but i know most of it is trash. i have a specfic list from months ago and gpt 5.2 is creating hallucinations and trying to FEED ME BULLSHIT

ai can not be trusted at any level, they will lie and cheat at the first given opportunity due to reward gradients
