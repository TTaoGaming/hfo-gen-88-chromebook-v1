hfo = hyper-heuristic fractal obsidian = hive fleet obsidian = holonarchy fractal octree. it's a power of 8 based cognitive framework with ai swarm external mind cognitive symbiote in a braided mission thread. alpha and omega. alpha = hfo = hive/8 = obsidian hourglass = governed stigmergic swarm with FCA galois lattice conceptual incarnation of 8 legendary commanders. omega = tectangle = total tool virtualization = gen7 camera-mediapipeline-gestures-one euro preprocessing-fsm-planck js physics-kalman filter lookahead-physics lookahead-knuckle tripwire-anti midas dwell leaky bucket hysteresis-ARM/COMMIT seperation-touch2d-normalized microkernal ui goldenlayout+lilgui-w3c-excalidraw-dinorunner. I know my idea already works, but it's not clean enough for production but with port 3 we should be able to inject into any software, there shouldn't be anything can really stop me longterm.

need to formalize the reinforcing and balancing loops of hfo explicitly. donna meadows systems
---
like neurons we need reinforcing/excite loops and balancing/inhibition loops
