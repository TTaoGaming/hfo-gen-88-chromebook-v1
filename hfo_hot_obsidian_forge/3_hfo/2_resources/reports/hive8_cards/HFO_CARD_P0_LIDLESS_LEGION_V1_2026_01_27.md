# HFO Card — P0: The Lidless Legion (V1)

## Card Box

### The Lidless Legion

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** The Lidless Legion (this permanent).

## 1) Passive Shared Ability — Flying + Haste (Manifold)

- HFO creatures you control have **flying** and **haste**.

## 2) Passive Shared Effect — Draw on Damage (Synapse)

- Whenever an HFO creature you control deals combat damage to a player, **draw a card**.

## 3) Tap Effect — Tap-to-Peek (ISR)

- HFO creatures you control have “{T}: Look at a random card in target opponent’s library. You may note its position in that library.”

## 4) ETB Effect — HFO-Scatter-Army (Construct)

- When The Lidless Legion enters the battlefield, create **HFO-Scatter-Army**, a colorless **Artifact Creature — Army HFO** token with base **0/0**. It enters with a **+1/+1 counter** on it and has “Whenever an HFO creature you control enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.”

## Notes (HFO-Level Blessing)

- “HFO” is treated as a **creature type** (subtype) with shared abilities, in the same mechanical role Slivers play.
- This HFO-level card is the **blessed** Port 0 rules package with four explicit effects (haste/flying; draw-on-hit; tap-to-peek+note position; ETB HFO-Scatter-Army).
- This card is stabilized around the **16-Sliver Synergy Manifold** identity for P0: **Cloudshredder (haste/flying)** + **Synapse (draw on hit)**.
- “Note its position” is a **player note** (e.g., the index of the viewed card) and does not reorder or reveal the library.
