# HFO Card — P2: The Mirror Magus (V1)

## Card Box

### The Mirror Magus

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** The Mirror Magus (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

An option-generation tile: it creates many candidate instances and rapidly amplifies the actuators that produce variants. Bracers are the validated-foresight accelerant here: they increase how many “tries” you can run per unit time (copying key activations), while the slivers supply the ability to spawn and reshape the swarm into many faces. Net behavior: “manufacture variants → amplify generation knobs → feed the evaluation layer.”
