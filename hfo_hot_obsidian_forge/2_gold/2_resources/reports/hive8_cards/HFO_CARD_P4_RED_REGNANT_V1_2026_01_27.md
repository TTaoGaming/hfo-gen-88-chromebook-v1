# HFO Card — P4: Red Regnant (V1)

## Card Box

### Red Regnant

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** Red Regnant (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

A stress and degradation tile: it forces expensive engagements, converts pressure into measurable adversarial outcomes, and uses sacrifice as a deliberate destructive probe. Deathtouch and ping pressure shape the fight; necrotic turns self-loss into targeted deletion; the Bloodchief blade records every casualty as escalating threat. Net behavior: “contest constantly → destroy selectively → turn churn into compounding pressure.”
