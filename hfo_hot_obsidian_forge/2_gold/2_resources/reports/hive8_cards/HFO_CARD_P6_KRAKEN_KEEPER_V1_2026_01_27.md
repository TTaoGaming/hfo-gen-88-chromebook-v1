# HFO Card — P6: Kraken Keeper (V1)

## Card Box

### Kraken Keeper

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** Kraken Keeper (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

A learning and assimilation tile: it converts operational experience into retained advantage and re-deployable patterns. Unearth posture makes the past usable, death-to-mass (amass) turns losses into reusable substrate, homing fetches missing components, and Sword of Fire and Ice explicitly couples “do work” with “log a lesson” on each successful engagement. Net behavior: “ingest outcomes → compress into reusable patterns → replay with improved odds.”
