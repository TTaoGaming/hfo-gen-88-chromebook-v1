# HFO Card — P0: The Lidless Legion (V1)

## Card Box

### The Lidless Legion

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** The Lidless Legion (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

A denied-environment sensing tile: it seeks contact fast, expects obstruction, and treats being blocked as a primary learning channel. It converts friction into information (lens-on-block), then applies local control to stabilize the picture long enough for downstream tiles to act. Net behavior: “probe → harvest signal from resistance → constrain the local scene → hand off validated observations.”

## Ability 0 — Passive Keyword Sharing — Flying + Haste (Manifold)

- HFO creatures you control have **flying** and **haste**.

## Ability 1 — Passive Effect — Draw on Damage (Synapse)

- Whenever an HFO creature you control deals combat damage to a player, **draw a card**.

## Ability 2 — Activated Effect — Tap-to-Peek (ISR)

- HFO creatures you control have “{T}: Roll a d8. Let X be the result. If X is greater than the number of cards in your library, subtract that number from X until X is within that range. Look at the card at position X from the top of your library. You may note that card’s position in your library.”

## Ability 3 — ETB Effect — HFO-SCATTER-ARMY (Scatter)

- When The Lidless Legion enters the battlefield, create **HFO-SCATTER-ARMY**, a colorless **Artifact Creature — Army HFO** token with base **0/0**. It enters with a **+1/+1 counter** on it for each **HFO permanent** you control.

## Notes (Gold-Level)

- “HFO” is treated as a **creature type** (subtype) with shared abilities, in the same mechanical role Slivers play.
- This Gold card is stabilized around the **16-Sliver Synergy Manifold** identity for P0: **Cloudshredder (haste/flying)** + **Synapse (draw on hit)**.
- “Note its position” is a **player note** (e.g., the index of the viewed card) and does not reorder or reveal the library.
- ISR intent: the d8 introduces **controlled randomness**; repeated samples (law of large numbers) are intended to be filtered via an external **evaluation harness** for high-signal extraction.
