# HFO Card — P5: Pyre Praetorian (V1)

## Card Box

### Pyre Praetorian

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** Pyre Praetorian (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

A defense-in-depth tile: it keeps the force package inside a survivability envelope while enabling controlled recovery. Indestructible posture reduces catastrophic loss, pulmonic biases toward continuity after death events, basal converts sacrifice into emergency fuel, and Sword of Light and Shadow couples sustained operation (life) with recoverability (return key pieces). Net behavior: “absorb shocks → recover capability → keep the system online.”
