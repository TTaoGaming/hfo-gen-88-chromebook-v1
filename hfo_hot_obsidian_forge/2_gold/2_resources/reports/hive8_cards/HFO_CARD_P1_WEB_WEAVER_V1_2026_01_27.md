# HFO Card — P1: The Web Weaver (V1)

## Card Box

### The Web Weaver

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** The Web Weaver (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

An interoperability tile: it exists to reduce coupling cost and keep cross-tile coordination fluid. It makes critical actions available at interface speed (flash posture), taxes hostile interference (diffusion), and supplies universal “bus power” (gemhide) while the equipment minting portable budget (Treasure) turns coordination into measurable throughput. Net behavior: “attach/detach quickly → keep links alive under disruption → fund the fabric.”

## Ability 0 — Passive Keyword Sharing — Ward {1}

- HFO creatures you control have **ward {1}**.

## Ability 1 — Passive Effect — Spend-As-Any-Color (Data Fabric)

- You may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast **HFO spells**.

## Ability 2 — Activated Effect — Add {C}

- HFO creatures you control have “{T}: Roll a d8. Add that many {C}.”

## Ability 3 — ETB Effect — HFO-SCATTER-ARMY (Scatter)

- When The Web Weaver enters the battlefield, create **HFO-SCATTER-ARMY**, a colorless **Artifact Creature — Army HFO** token with base **0/0**. It enters with a **+1/+1 counter** on it for each **HFO permanent** you control.

## Notes (Gold-Level)

- “HFO” is treated as a **creature type** (subtype) with shared abilities, in the same mechanical role Slivers play.
- “Bridge” is modeled as a JADC2 shared data fabric: color-agnostic casting for HFO spells plus consistent bandwidth ({C}) generation.

## Grimoire Hooks

- Alias cluster anchor: hyper fractal obsidian grimoire ⇄ galois lattice ⇄ declarative gherkin ⇄ heartbeat mantra ⇄ quine ⇄ gem gene seed ⇄ hydra buds
