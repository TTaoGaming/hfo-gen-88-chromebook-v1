# HFO Card — P7: Spider Sovereign (V1)

## Card Box

### Spider Sovereign

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** Spider Sovereign (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

A command-and-control tile: it composes the force package, accelerates tasking, and keeps the command node protected and online. Legion provides global posture, brood compounds momentum from contact, overlord performs assembly/tasking, and Lightning Greaves ensures immediate readiness with protection so the first command cycle happens before disruption. Net behavior: “assemble → task → scale → retask under pressure.”
