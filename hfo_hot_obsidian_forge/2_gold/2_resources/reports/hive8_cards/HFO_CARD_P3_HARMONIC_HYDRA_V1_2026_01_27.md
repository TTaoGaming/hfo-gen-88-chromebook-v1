# HFO Card — P3: Harmonic Hydra (V1)

## Card Box

### Harmonic Hydra

**Type line:** Legendary Creature — HFO

**Controlled HFO (HFO under control):** Harmonic Hydra (this permanent).

## Tactical Role (C2 / JADC2 / Mosaic Tile)

An effects-delivery tile: it’s built for fan-out, on-arrival payload, and re-deploy semantics. Cascade posture pushes payloads broadly, harmonic provides the “payload on entry,” hibernation provides backoff/retry (bounce/recast), and Blade of Selves adds burst replication during delivery waves. Net behavior: “deliver broadly → apply payload on contact → retry until state change sticks.”
