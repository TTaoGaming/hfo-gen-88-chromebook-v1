# HFO — OBSIDIAN Powerwords ↔ JADC2 Domain Map (V1)

## The Vocabulary (powerwords)

The eight HFO powerwords spell:

**O–B–S–I–D–I–A–N**

This is a deliberate mnemonic tying the 8-port lattice to operational domains.

## Port Mapping (P0 → P7)

| Port | Powerword | Letter |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | OBSERVE | O |
| P1 | BRIDGE | B |
| P2 | SHAPE | S |
| P3 | INJECT | I |
| P4 | DISRUPT | D |
| P5 | IMMUNIZE | I |
| P6 | ASSIMILATE | A |
| P7 | NAVIGATE | N |

## JADC2 Domain Mapping

| Letter | Powerword | JADC2 Domain |
|---|---|---|
| O | OBSERVE | ISR |
| B | BRIDGE | Data Fabric |
| S | SHAPE | Shaping |
| I | INJECT | Delivery |
| D | DISRUPT | Red Team |
| I | IMMUNIZE | Blue Team |
| A | ASSIMILATE | AAR/Store |
| N | NAVIGATE | Navigate |

## Fractal Microturn (0→1→2→3) — Canonical for P0–P3

The first four ports (P0–P3) also define a **canonical 4-step microcycle** that composes fractally.

| Micro Phase | Port | Powerword | Domain aliases |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | P0 | OBSERVE | sense / ISR / tools / context acquisition |
| 1 | P1 | BRIDGE | connect / fuse / synthesize / data fabric |
| 2 | P2 | SHAPE | transform / materialize / normalize |
| 3 | P3 | INJECT | deliver / dispatch / broadcast |

Composition rule: completed artifacts become the next cycle’s “environment” (baton across ports; stigmergy across turns).

Gating rule: “inject/broadcast” (stigmergy) is emitted only after strict validation of the produced object.

## Notes

- This mapping is treated as **Gold vocabulary**: stable, repeatable, and used as labels in turn artifacts and meta synthesis.
- Any alternative naming must preserve the **OBSIDIAN** letter sequence and the 8-domain correspondence.
