# HFO HIVE8 — P7 (NAVIGATE): SPIDER SOVEREIGN / NAVIGATE

You are reading a translation ladder:
1) 3+1 cards → 2) analogies/examples → 3) JADC2 vocab → 4) Meadows vocab.

---

## Commander identity (SSOT-locked)
- **port_id**: P7
- **commander_name**: SPIDER SOVEREIGN
- **powerword**: NAVIGATE
- **mosaic_tile**: NAVIGATE
- **jadc2_domain**: Battle Management Command and Control (Navigator)
- **mosaic_domain (mapping)**: C2 / navigate / hunt heuristics
- **trigram**: Qian (☰), element Heaven
- **octree bits**: 111

---

## Step 0 — Galois lattice identity (Diagonal + Anti-diagonal)
- **Anti-diagonal partner (sum-to-7)**: P0
- **Anti-diagonal stage**: 0 (P0 + P7)
- **Stage meaning**: Hindsight → Alignment (sensor fusion → mission-thread navigation)
- **Scatter/Gather partition**: GATHER (converge)
- **Meta-promoted deliverables count**: 1

## Step 1 — The 3+1 cards (SSOT)
- **Sliver (static)**: Sliver Legion
- **Sliver (trigger)**: Regal Sliver
- **Sliver (activated)**: Sliver Overlord
- **Equipment**: Lightning Greaves

---

## Step 2 — Plain-language analogies + concrete examples
### (A) Sliver Legion (static)
Analogy: **Global objective alignment** — every sub-agent/port “gets stronger” when the commander clarifies the mission thread.
Examples:
- Publish a single turn objective and 2–3 non-negotiable constraints (time, scope, integrity).
- Convert many local tasks into one coherent direction (“optimize the fleet, not the ship”).
- Make the plan legible so P4–P6 can gate/suppress the right things without guessing.

### (B) Regal Sliver (trigger)
Analogy: **Legitimacy triggers coordination** — when authority is recognized, coordination becomes cheaper and faster.
Examples:
- When a plan is accepted as “the plan,” downstream ports stop thrashing and align.
- Use legitimacy to prune: fewer objectives, clearer constraints, fewer contradictory tasks.
- Watch the failure mode: legitimacy without audit becomes dogma; keep provenance visible (P6) and allow challenge (P4).

### (C) Sliver Overlord (activated)
Analogy: **Orchestration + retrieval of capabilities** — pay cost to fetch the exact tool/agent/asset you need, and re-assert control.
Examples:
- “Tutor” the right port: if stuck, call the correct commander rather than overloading P7.
- Pull the right contract/schema/pointer before acting (don’t navigate on missing interfaces).
- Reclaim wandering scope: collapse divergent threads into a single prioritized backlog.

### (D) Lightning Greaves (equipment)
Analogy: **Fast startup + protected command channel** — move immediately (haste) and resist interference (shroud).
Examples:
- Make the handoff decision quickly, then lock it (prevent churn / mid-turn reprioritization).
- Protect “navigation state” (current objective, invariants, pointers) from ad-hoc edits.
- Tradeoff: too much shroud reduces debuggability; you still need audit trails (P5/P6).

---

## Step 3 — Translate into JADC2 mosaic vocabulary
- **Domain label (SSOT)**: Battle Management Command and Control (Navigator) / C2 / navigate / hunt heuristics
- **What the port produces**: Navigation decisions, mission-thread constraints, orchestration plans
- **What the port rejects**: Goal drift, ambiguous priorities, unbounded scope expansion

Galois handoff (P0 + P7 stage 0):
- **P0 → P7**: ranked evidence + uncertainty (what is true enough to steer by).
- **P7 → P0**: attention/priority constraints (what to sense next; what to ignore).

---

## Step 4 — Translate into Donna Meadows systems thinking
### Stocks
- Mission thread state (current objective + constraints)
- Plan backlog (ranked candidate actions)
- Alignment energy (how consistently the system is pulling in one direction)
- Trust in the current navigation state (credibility of plan)

### Flows
- Planning flow (evidence → hypotheses → decisions)
- Delegation flow (decisions → port work packets)
- Drift flow (unbounded scope expansion, rework)
- Pruning flow (killing branches, collapsing threads)

### Feedback loops
- Reinforcing: clearer objective (Sliver Legion) → better port outputs → better evidence → clearer objective
- Reinforcing: validated wins (Brood) → more reusable playbooks → faster future navigation
- Balancing: too many branches → overhead → pruning → stable throughput
- Balancing: interference/noise → command protection (Greaves) → reduced churn

### Delays
- Evidence-to-decision delay (P0 signals arriving + being trusted)
- Decision-to-execution delay (dispatch → port action → results)
- Drift detection delay (scope creep visible only after cost)

### Leverage points
- System goals: define success explicitly and keep it stable for a turn (Legion)
- Rules: enforce “one navigation decision” and prune aggressively (Brood discipline)
- Information flows: make uncertainty visible and auditable (P0→P7, P5/P6 provenance)

### Failure modes
- Goal drift masked as exploration (navigation churn)
- Over-spawning: too many “brood” branches leading to thrash
- Over-shrouding: protected plan with no auditability (can’t debug failures)
- Control illusion: tutoring tools instead of producing an actionable handoff

---

## Quick mental model (one sentence)
P7 turns evidence into a protected, pruned plan and hands P0 the next sensing priorities.
