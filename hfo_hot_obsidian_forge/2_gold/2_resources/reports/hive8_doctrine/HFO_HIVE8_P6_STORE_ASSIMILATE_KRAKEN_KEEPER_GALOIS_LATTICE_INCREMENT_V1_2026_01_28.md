# HFO HIVE8 — P6 (STORE): KRAKEN KEEPER / ASSIMILATE

You are reading a translation ladder:
1) 3+1 cards → 2) analogies/examples → 3) JADC2 vocab → 4) Meadows vocab.

## Commander identity (SSOT-locked)
- **port_id**: P6
- **commander_name**: KRAKEN KEEPER
- **powerword**: ASSIMILATE
- **mosaic_tile**: STORE
- **jadc2_domain**: Post-Mission Analysis / Data Repository (Assimilator)
- **mosaic_domain (mapping)**: AAR / learning / assimilation
- **trigram**: Dui (☱), element Lake
- **octree bits**: 110

## Step 0 — Galois lattice identity (Diagonal + Anti-diagonal)
- **Anti-diagonal partner (sum-to-7)**: P1
- **Anti-diagonal stage**: 1 (P1 + P6)
- **Stage meaning**: Insight → Memory (interlocking interfaces → deep recall / exemplars)
- **Scatter/Gather partition**: GATHER (converge)
- **Meta-promoted deliverables count**: 1

## Step 1 — The 3+1 cards (SSOT)
- **Sliver (static)**: Dregscape Sliver
- **Sliver (trigger)**: Lazotep Sliver
- **Sliver (activated)**: Homing Sliver
- **Equipment**: Sword of Fire and Ice

---

## Step 2 — Plain-language analogies + concrete examples
### (A) Dregscape Sliver (static)
Analogy: **Bring back useful context for one more turn** — retrieval is powerful but often *ephemeral* (unearth).
Examples:
- Restore a past exemplar to guide the current decision, then let it expire (avoid hoarding).
- “Resurrect” a prior working state (schema, workflow) to unblock a stuck port.
- Treat temporary recalls as probes; the SSOT is the permanent truth.

### (B) Lazotep Sliver (trigger)
Analogy: **Memory hardens under targeting** — when something tries to touch/target the system, you grow a defensive mass (amass).
Examples:
- When a write attempt happens, require provenance + gate checks; otherwise quarantine.
- Turn adversarial pressure into stronger guardrails (audit logs, signed receipts).
- If a tool starts “reward hacking,” expand suppression and tighten allowed write paths.

### (C) Homing Sliver (activated)
Analogy: **Pay to search the library** — retrieval is an *active* operation with cost; you fetch the right piece.
Examples:
- Use semantic search / vector lookup to retrieve the most relevant exemplar.
- Provide a stable query surface so agents stop inventing facts.
- When uncertain, retrieve multiple candidates and rank by provenance.

### (D) Sword of Fire and Ice (equipment)
Analogy: **Retrieval that yields both insight and energy** — draw a card (learn) and deal damage (act on what you learned).
Examples:
- On a successful recall, emit a short actionable summary + a concrete next step.
- Use retrieval to reduce both “overanalysis” (ice) and “overreaction” (fire) by grounding actions.
- Protect the memory core from noisy channels while still letting learning flow.

---

## Step 3 — Translate into JADC2 mosaic vocabulary
- **Domain label (SSOT)**: Post-Mission Analysis / Data Repository (Assimilator) / AAR / learning / assimilation
- **What the port produces**: Indexed memory, exemplars, retrieval surfaces, SSOT snapshots
- **What the port rejects**: Unprovenanced memory writes, orphaned artifacts, duplicate truths

Galois handoff (P1 + P6 stage 1):
- **P1 → P6**: schemas + manifests that make ingestion safe and queryable.
- **P6 → P1**: exemplars + recall APIs that keep future bindings grounded in what actually worked.

---

## Step 4 — Translate into Donna Meadows systems thinking
### Stocks
- SSOT truth store (blessed write-path)
- Indexed memories (embeddings, metadata, links)
- Exemplars (high-signal, reusable cases)
- Integrity posture (guards, provenance, quarantine state)

### Flows
- Ingestion flow (artifacts → SSOT)
- Indexing flow (SSOT → searchable surfaces)
- Retrieval flow (queries → candidates → summaries)
- Decay/curation flow (remove/retire low-signal items)

### Feedback loops
- Reinforcing: better retrieval → better decisions → better artifacts → better retrieval
- Balancing: adversarial/tainted writes → guards (Lazotep) → fewer unsafe writes
- Balancing: too much memory → curation → reduced noise → higher quality retrieval

### Delays
- Ingestion/indexing delay (new truth takes time to become searchable)
- Learning delay (insights take time to alter upstream behavior)
- Poison detection delay (taint may be invisible until queried)

### Leverage points
- Rules: single write-path SSOT, fail-closed provenance (Lazotep)
- Information flows: retrieval surfaces that prevent agents from hallucinating (Homing)
- Goals: prefer high-signal exemplars over “more data” (Dregscape discipline)

### Failure modes
- Duplicate truths: multiple stores treated as authoritative
- Memory poisoning: unvetted writes corrupt retrieval
- Orphaned artifacts: data without links/provenance becomes unusable
- Retrieval theater: long recalls that don’t produce actionable steps (Sword mismatch)

## Quick mental model (one sentence)
P6 turns artifacts into provable, retrievable truth and feeds P1 exemplars that keep the fabric grounded.
