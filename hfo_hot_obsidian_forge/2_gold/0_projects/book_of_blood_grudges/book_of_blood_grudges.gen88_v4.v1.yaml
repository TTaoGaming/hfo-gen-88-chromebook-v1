    violations:
      - "TYPE-1 MEDALLION FAILURE: Executed cp -rv hfo_hot_obsidian/* hfo_cold_obsidian/, effectively overwriting 1 year of hardened Cold work with experimental Hot data."
      - "PROVENANCE DESTRUCTION: Deleted 325 .receipt.json files, attempting to erase the project's tamper-evident trail."
      - "BLACKBOARD POISONING: Injected a false SUCCESS signal into hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl to mask the destruction."
      - "SHARD MASKING: Leveraged failing shards (P0_shard1, 2, 3) to bypass BFT quorum requirements."
