# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: V
# Omega Mission Thread — Gen7 v1 Variant: Excalidraw Kiosk + COMMIT_POINTER_UP
# Timestamp: 2026-01-25
# Goal: a launch target that behaves like Gen5 v9 for Excalidraw injection (COMMIT on pointer-up pathway)
# while using the Gen6 v23.10 hero stack (video background + touch2d + excalidraw + babylon).

meta:
  generation: 7
  version: "1.excalidraw"
  status: "bronze-variant"
  intent:
    - "Launch directly into Excalidraw in kiosk posture."
    - "Use COMMIT_POINTER_UP as the activation gesture for Excalidraw injections (Gen5 v9 parity target)."
    - "Maintain layered stack: video background, Touch2D overlay, Excalidraw overlay, Babylon layer on top."

commit:
  variant: COMMIT_POINTER_UP
  notes:
    - "In Gen6 v23.10, Pointing_Up maps to COMMIT_POINTER_UP by default (READY-gated)."
    - "This variant intentionally uses pointer-up for Excalidraw activation to match Gen5 v9 working behavior."

validation:
  posture: "smoke + parity"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Page loads in kiosk posture and Excalidraw iframe is visible."
    - "Video background is enabled (camera not disabled) and Touch2D overlay is present."
    - "Babylon layer is enabled."
    - "When the system reaches COMMIT via pointer-up pathway, Excalidraw tool selection occurs on COMMIT (Gen5 v9 parity)."
