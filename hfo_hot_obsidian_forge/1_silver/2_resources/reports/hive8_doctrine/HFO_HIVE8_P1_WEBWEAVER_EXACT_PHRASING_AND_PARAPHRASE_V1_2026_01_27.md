# HFO HIVE8 — P1 WebWeaver: Exact Phrasing + Paraphrase (V1)

## Exact Phrasing (quoted)

- “formalize Port 1 as “The WebWeaver” with alias “Swarm Lord of Webs,” plus a tactical C2/JADC2 mosaic-tile role, and an artifact protocol that outputs in 8 “colors” (0–7 rainbow + hidden shadow color with black/red edges).”
- “You also required meta synthesis to present the Top 2 colors and explicit validators.”
- “ok please proceed, save down some of my exact phrasing and paraphrase my requests to you.”

## Paraphrase (what you want, in my own words)

- Lock in Port 1’s identity as the “WebWeaver” persona (also known as “Swarm Lord of Webs”) as the tactical web/bridge layer for C2/JADC2-style mosaic-tile coordination.
- Make the P1 turn artifact structurally emit an 8-lane “color weave” output (lanes 0–6 plus lane 7 “shadow”), with the shadow lane explicitly marked by black + red edge semantics.
- Ensure each turn’s meta synthesis auto-surfaces P1’s Top 2 selected colors and includes machine-checkable validator results (pass/fail) proving the artifact shape is compliant.

## Notes

- This report is intentionally short and quote-first.
- If you want higher fidelity “exact phrasing”, I can switch to capturing raw chat excerpts verbatim per turn (with timestamps) into a dedicated HIVE8 chat-log artifact.
