# HFO HIVE8 — Operator Phrases: Non‑Fixed Prompts + Grimoire Alias Cluster (V1)

## Objective

Preserve the operator’s exact phrasing (ground truth) and a minimal paraphrase so the HIVE8 turn engine remains:

- prompt‑general (not a fixed questionnaire)
- contract‑driven (8 artifacts + 1 meta + 1 stigmergy)
- anchored on the Grimoire / Galois lattice identity cluster

## Exact Phrasing (verbatim)

- “just search for hyper fractal obsidian grimoire. galoise lattice. hydra buds, buds, gem, quine. usually with hfo prefix.”
- “and the names should be self documenting with timestamps normally.”
- “can you help me add this to the doobidoo memory as important words.”
- “they all fall under the alias of the hfo grimoire = galois lattice = declarative gherkin = heartbeat mantra = quine = gem gene seed = gem”
- “oh no you don't understand it's not a fixed question this is just an example”
- “the hive/8 needs to be able to answer the question \"best api integration with mediapipeline taskss\" and use my ide and my tools to produce the 8+1 artifact”
- “what we'll consolidate on is template.”
- “ports 0-3 all have a army token with effect, a passive hfo shared effect, and a active hfo effect.”
- “i want this in hot obsidian gold forge. and the memory system sqlite.”
- “the main thing we need to do is to consolidate the galoise lattice identity”
- “I think this will be enough to help me anchor along with declarative gherkin software and jadc2 and likely 1 more lens like mermaid diagram to create a quad card.”
- “this is a new concept help me create it into hfo gold.”
- “we'll create a quad card for hfo and then each 8 legendary commander”

## Paraphrase (minimal)

- The HIVE8 agent must handle arbitrary operator prompts (e.g., MediaPipe API integration questions) and still emit the fixed artifact envelope (8 port artifacts + 1 meta synthesis + 1 stigmergy).
- The “Grimoire” is an alias cluster used as an identity anchor and should be explicitly searchable and ingestible into the SSOT memory (Doobidoo sqlite_vec).
- The HFO quad‑card lens is the consolidation target: (1) Galois lattice identity, (2) declarative gherkin/acceptance, (3) JADC2 mosaic tile role, (4) mermaid lens.
- Ports P0–P3 share a token template: army token effect + passive shared effect + active effect.
