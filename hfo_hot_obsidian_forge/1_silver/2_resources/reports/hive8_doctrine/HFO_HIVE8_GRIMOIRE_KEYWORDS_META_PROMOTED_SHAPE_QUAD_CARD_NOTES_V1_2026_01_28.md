# HFO HIVE8 — Grimoire Keywords + Meta-Promoted Shape + Quad-Card Notes (V1)

## Objective

Capture operator vocabulary + the intended HIVE8 meta-promoted shape as a stable, searchable doctrine fragment.

## Operator Phrasing (Exact)

- “so in the metasynthesis Would probably be something like. Port 0. Two observations … Then it will be port 7. And it would be one. I am not sure what yet … Port one. With two … Port 6 with one iridescent Pearl mermaid diagram. In UML format … Port 2 … two reflections … port 5 … one firewall … Port 3 … 2 injections … Port 4 will sing one song.”
- “This is really important. I really need you to make sure it's written down.”
- “Put in. Galois Lattice. The names of the eight legendary commanders. That are the self referential diagonal. And then the Hive base aid workflow which is the anti diagonal. So that all the port numbers sum up to 7.”
- “just search for hyper fractal obsidian grimoire. galoise lattice. hydra buds, buds, gem, quine. usually with hfo prefix.”
- “they all fall under the alias of the hfo grimoire = galois lattice = declarative gherkin = heartbeat mantra = quine = gem gene seed = gem”
- “oh no you don't understand it's not a fixed question this is just an example, the hive/8 needs to be able to answer the question … and use my ide and my tools to produce the 8+1 artifact”
- “what we'll consolidate on is template. ports 0-3 all have a army token with effect, a passive hfo shared effect, and a active hfo effect. i want this in hot obsidian gold forge. and the memory system sqlite.”
- “this is a new concept help me create it into hfo gold. we'll create a quad card for hfo and then each 8 legendary commander”

## Paraphrase (Intent)

- Meta synthesis promotes a **typed** deliverable per port (not just “any bullet”), with strict counts.
- The Galois lattice has two critical views:
  - **Diagonal**: commander identities (P0–P7).
  - **Anti-diagonal**: paired workflow stages (0+7 → 1+6 → 2+5 → 3+4).
- “Grimoire” is treated as an alias-cluster vocabulary intended for tagging and retrieval across artifacts + memory.
- HIVE8 must be able to answer arbitrary operator prompts, while keeping the 8+1 artifact scaffolding stable.

## Meta-Promoted Shape (Port Order)

- P0: two observations (2)
- P7: one alignment / navigation handoff (1)
- P1: two interface bindings / top colors (2)
- P6: one iridescent pearl (UML-flavored Mermaid) (1)
- P2: two reflections (2)
- P5: one firewall / gate (1)
- P3: two injections (2)
- P4: one song (1)
