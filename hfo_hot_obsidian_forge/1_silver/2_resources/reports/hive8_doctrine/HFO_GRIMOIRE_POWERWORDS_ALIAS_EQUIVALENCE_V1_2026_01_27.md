# HFO Grimoire — Powerwords + Alias Equivalence (V1)

## Objective

Freeze the operator vocabulary so HIVE8 turns can label concepts consistently (and search them reliably).

## Operator Phrasing (Exact)

- “hyper fractal obsidian grimoire. galoise lattice. hydra buds, buds, gem, quine. usually with hfo prefix.”
- “the names should be self documenting with timestamps normally.”
- “they all fall under the alias of the hfo grimoire = galois lattice = declarative gherkin = heartbeat mantra = quine = gem gene seed = gem”

## Paraphrase (Intent)

- Treat these terms as *synonyms / faces of one construct*.
- Use them as stable tags/keywords across artifacts, memory, and meta synthesis.
- Prefer self-documenting filenames with timestamps for new doctrine.

## Canonical Alias Equivalence (SSOT)

These strings are treated as equivalent labels for the same conceptual “spellbook”:

- `hfo_grimoire`
- `galois_lattice` (operator also wrote “galoise lattice”)
- `declarative_gherkin`
- `heartbeat_mantra`
- `quine`
- `gem_gene_seed`
- `gem`

## Keyword Set (Recommended Tags)

- `hyper_fractal_obsidian`
- `grimoire`
- `galois_lattice`
- `mosaic_warfare`
- `scatter_gather`
- `double_diamond`
- `pdca`
- `strange_loop`
- `powers_of_two`
- `hydra_buds`
- `kraken_tendrils`
- `iridescent_pearl`

## Wiring into HIVE8 Turns (Label Rules)

- Port artifacts may include these as **tags** in frontmatter and as short **labels** inside the body.
- Meta synthesis should surface them as explicit labels in:
  - Scatter/Gather map
  - Cardinality contract validation
  - Meta-promoted deliverables section

## Open Loop

- Decide if `hydra_buds` should be a formal P3 required section (similar to Top Picks / Mermaid Bank).
