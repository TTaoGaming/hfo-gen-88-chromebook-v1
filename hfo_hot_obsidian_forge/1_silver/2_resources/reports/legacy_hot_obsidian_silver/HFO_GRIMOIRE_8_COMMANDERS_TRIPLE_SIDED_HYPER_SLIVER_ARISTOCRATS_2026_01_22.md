# HFO Grimoire — 8 Legendary Commander Cards (Triple-Sided) + Hyper Sliver Aristocrats

## Provenance (Evidence-First)

This Silver grimoire consolidates the existing “triple-sided commander cards” doctrine and the “hyper sliver aristocrat sacrifice” deck metaphor into one integration anchor.

Primary sources (verbatim, canonical):

- `hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/4_archive/areas_archive_2026_01_18/mission_thread_omega/LEGENDARY_HFO_COMMANDERS_TRIPLE_SIDED.md`

Errata / operator corrections:

- **Port 0 trigram/binary mapping**: operator correction (2026-01-22): **P0 = 000 / Earth**. This Silver SSOT reflects the correction even if older Bronze drafts differ.
- **Canonical port→binary→trigram order (operator)** (2026-01-22):
  - **P0** = 000 = **Kun (Earth)**
  - **P1** = 100 = **Gen (Mountain)**
  - **P2** = 010 = **Kan (Water)**
  - **P3** = 110 = **Xun (Wind)**
  - **P4** = 001 = **Zhen (Thunder)**
  - **P5** = 101 = **Li (Fire)**
  - **P6** = 011 = **Dui (Lake)**
  - **P7** = 111 = **Qian (Heaven)**

## The Triple-Sided Commander Cards (P0–P7)

Each commander card is defined with three equivalent “sides”:

- **Side A**: MTG narrative/mechanics (literate programming)
- **Side B**: Gherkin declarative (software logic)
- **Side C**: JADC2 Mosaic (doctrinal grounding)

## Hyper Sliver Aristocrats (Deck Metaphor)

The grounded deck structure is captured as a **32-card half-deck**:

- **8 core** = the 8 commander tiles (P0–P7)
- **24 supplements** = **16 slivers** (2 per port) + **8 MTG anchors** (1 per port)

## Notes / Drift Flags

- Older artifacts may contain a P3 commander naming variant (“Spore Storm” vs “Harmonic Hydra”); the current doctrine and memory entries confirm **Harmonic Hydra** as the P3 commander.
