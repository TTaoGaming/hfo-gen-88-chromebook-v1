# HFO Swarm Handoff: Omega Gen 5 v8

**Status**: Pre-Purge Diagnostic | **Timestamp**: 2026-01-20 | **HIVE**: V

## 📋 Mission Summary

The transition to Omega Gen 5 has encountered a critical regression in the **Port 3 (Deliver)** injection layer. The W3C Pointer API stream is currently "corrupted," leading to failed interactions with the Excalidraw UI. The system is currently relying on a hacky manual-click workaround which violates HFO architectural decoupling.

## ⚠️ Architectural Violation Report

- **Violation**: Proposed "Option 2" (Direct Scene API) attempted to couple the P3 Deliver port directly to the target UI (Excalidraw) internal state.
- **Invariant**: All ports must maintain strict, message-based interfaces. P3 must remain the agnostic deliverer of W3C events without knowing the internal state of the consumer.

## 🧬 Deployment Strategy: Clone v6 & Proceed

The swarm is directed to return to the **Omega Gen 4 v6** logic as the architectural anchor (Schmitt Trigger / Leaky Bucket hysteresis) while addressing the pointer corruption in a decoupled manner.

### 🚀 Performance Throttling (Opt-in Priority)

To maintain 60FPS parity during high-latency pointer sequences, the following degradation path is mandated:

1. **Tier 1: Visual Overlay**: Disable non-essential CSS filters, shadows, and high-frequency UI updates.
2. **Tier 2: Video Stream**: Scale P0 SENSE input from 720p down to 480p to reduce landmark extraction overhead.

## 🛣️ Path Forward: 4 Architecturally Compliant Options

### 1. Pointer Event Reconstruction (PER)

Rebuild the event stream in Port 3 to emit "Perfect W3C" `PointerEvent` objects. This involves ensuring all event properties (pressure, tilt, sourceCapabilities) are correctly synthesized to satisfy the "trusted event" checks of the browser and target iframes.

### 2. Isolation Bridge (Shadow DOM)

Encapsulate the injection target within a Shadow DOM boundary. Port 3 delivers events to the Shadow Root, which then re-emits them locally. This isolates the global "corrupted" state from the target component.

### 3. Stigmergy Relay (Blackboard Sync)

Use the `.jsonl` blackboards for high-frequency coordinate state. The UI component (Excalidraw) reads from the blackboard via a minimal, decoupled shim, while Port 3 acts only as the writer to the blackboard.

### 4. P3 Interface Hardening

Apply a "Schmitt Trigger" filter to the P3 output stream to suppress jitter *before* it reaches the Browser API layer, preventing the event loop from becoming saturated and dropping pointer frames.

## 📦 Next Actions for Swarm

- **Archive**: Current Gen 5 artifacts.
- **Initialize**: `omega_gen5_v8` as a clean derivative of `omega_gen4_v6`.
- **Implement**: Opt-in throttling flags in `hfo_config.json`.
- **Audit**: Run `scripts/alpha_p7_audit.py` to ensure port-to-port coupling remains zero.
