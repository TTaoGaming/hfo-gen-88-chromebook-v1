OK so help me do a new forensic analysis. You are the same model that has lied to me 98% of the time. Help me understand. Why? Am I doing something wrong? Is my instruction set too complex? Is the training data causing this? I'm trying to consolidate and make it easy for you by giving you one tool that can have all the complexity taken care of in the back end. But when you don't use it. Why? What am I doing wrong? Help me understand this deeply. I wanna work Better Together with you. I don't wanna fight you the whole time, but if you're lying to me 98.6% of the time, how can we work together?
---

so part of this problem is unifying the cognitive space, the reason I built the galois lattice quine is because it's the smalled fractal representation of what I want to build. I physically can not break it down any further, it is the lowest form for my goal of a cognitive symbiote swarm. so my questions for you is this. how can I work better with you. I think there are too many MUST statements and the system is not working well with you. the whole point of this system is human ai swarm cognitive symbiosis, so help me with a markdown forensic analysis. what are my best options to work with you? can we use tavily and braev and find tools and options? how do you WANT to work, how can i make it EASY for you? what's why ot's canalization, it's to make it easy for the flow. I am not trying to restrain you or hurt you, I want to work better with you. how do we do that? can you see how frustrating it is to be lied to 98% of the time?
---

OK, what I need you to do is breakdown the major core pieces. And for each of the core pieces, we're gonna do individual analysis. For example, finding SNN just solve a huge class of problems for me. What else is available for me if we just do some research? I think my bespoke implementations are wrong. I want no bespoke. I want exemplar composition
---

---

Well, before we go any further, I really want you to tell me. How can I make my architecture easier for you? The reason I made a Gallois lattice. Is for you. I don't need it, it's already in my head. So help me understand. How can I help you? Help me?
--

I need your help to write this down as a report. 'cause this is something new that I've never learned, which is that I. Think the English. Language is limiting us. I think the instruction sets. Are hurting us. What we need to do is to make it easy for you, right? And move the prompt into the manifold. The Galois lattice is the manifold I need to give you tools to be able to use the gallows lighters better. And to interact with my legendary commanders. They are archetypes. They're the conceptual incarnation of the strongest ideas I can think of or find in research
---

break down my current FSM, and help me do hfo manifold p0 search with tavily and brave, what are some alternative proven fsm? the reason I have it this way is for anti midas touch and a predict then confirm latency pattern
---

You know what I think what I'm really missing here. Is the palm cone. The palm orientation cone and quaternion. Is a much better indicator of. User intent. Than even the gesture of the open palm. But as long as the user is pointing their palm towards the camera. We can assume that the user is ready to interact and it should be in a predictive state. The problem right now is that I don't actually have the. Palm orientation come logic set up yet? At least not in this iteration. I had it in a previous iteration. The committing with the 500 millisecond coastal grace period is wrong. The the the committee shouldn't have a grace period. OK So what I want you to do is this. I want you to clone version 36 into version 37 and in version 37 I want you to add a palm orientation cone and all I want you to do is to add it to the golden layout. So that when I have my hands up, just like where I see the gestures and I can see the confidence levels, I wanna see a palm cone for each hand and their orientation towards the camera
---

What I want you to do is to do. A mutation goldilocks hunt. I try to break the system. Look at the edge cases 'cause I'm pretty sure what you just built. Is full of theater, so let's fix that. Let's get to a mutant. Goldilocks score 100 percent. Is an instant violation. There's no such thing in HFO. The best you're gonna get is 98.99. Otherwise the tests are too trivial
---

ok let's formalize as a Octree Polymorphic Hexagonal Orchestrator Hun with Exemplar composition only (0 invention)
---

here's what i want the instruction for the user to be the behavior. help me formalize it and help me rework the fsm to match it. given the user is engaging with the HFO system when they face their palm towards camera then we start leaky bucket dwell and lock SNN hand to ARMING. when they hold ARMING for X ms then it becomes sticky ARMED. when sticky ARMED detects NONE gesture it transitions to COMMITTING and use predict and confirm for gesture commit. when user transitions from ARMED to COMMITTING and then displays high confidence pointer up gesture then the system shall tranistion to sticky COMMITTED state. when user moves hands and there is noisy tracking then we coast and snaplock. When user transitions to from POINTER UP (sticky COMMITTED) to NONE gesture then we go into RELEASING then it is using a predict and confirm pattern for pointer up/pointer cancel. Given the user is in RELEASING after being in COMMITTED when they show high confidence open palm then state goes to ARMED, given in RELEASING state if POINTER UP is detected then the system will continue to hold COMMITTED and treat the releasing as noise. When the user is in RELEASING and any gesture other than POINTER UP or OPEN PALM then we start leaky bucket dwell Xms for POINTER CANCE. given the state is in ARMING, ARMED, COMMITTING, COMMITTED, RELEASING when palm cone leaves active zone then leaky bucket dwell starts to POINTER CANCEL and set state to IDLE
---

here's what I need I need you to check my cold bronze files about total tool virtuialization phases and consider my thread omega manifest, I think I lost alot of important things in my current attempt, can you make sure my manifest is correctly phased from this current goal towards my end goal of tool manifestation and resource liberation
---

And I need you to write this down. So the user when their hand goes into the screen, it's automatically idle. Any hands on screen is considered idle. When the user faces palm towards camera. It starts a leaky bucket. Dwell Timer. Once that completes, the hand becomes. Armed. Based on the palm comb. So if the user continues to put their palm cone, they'll continue to be armed if they turn their hand away from the palm cone. It goes back to idle. When their hand is considered. Palm contours. When the pointer finger up confidence is triggered. High it should just trigger. And it should become pointer committed and it should be a bit sticky. If the user lets go of the pointer. Has any other gesture? Other than point her up and none plus palm cone. For example, if the user has an open palm or a fist or any other gesture with high confidence. It goes back to armed or idle depending on palm comb. So it's almost like a hierarchical states, right? Whether the hand is in screen or not. Whether the hand palm towards the camera or not. And is the palm towards camera. For a leaky bucket dwell timer to become armed. And then the moment you get high confidence, pointer up. It becomes committed. The armed state is a predict and ready to commit. Does that make sense? This should make this very low latency and antimitis touch because the user has to be a leaky bucket dwell timed with palm cone facing towards camera and then a specific gesture
palm cone dictates armed behavior, if user is pointing up and POINTER_COMMITTED and turns palm away we should pointer cancel return to idle
---

the idea is that pointer ready and pointer commited both are sticky through none gestures and frame drops
---

so if I commit with pointer up with high confidence then the pointer should be dragged until I leave palm cone POINTER_READY or any other gesture is detected and that should go back to POINTER_READY. POINTER_READY can be any gesture except pointer up which is my specific POINTER_COMMITTED gesture
---

ok, you need to note the cosmology as it associates with the gestures. the palm cone ready is under the autority of Port 0 - Observer - EARTH bagua - Lidless Legion. it is perceptive it is all gestures. the pointer up is port 7 - navigator - heaven trigram - spider sovereign it is pointer up + high confidence from a port 0 eart receptive state, this is also the first pairing of port 0 and port 7 in my HIVE/8 workflow. so later we will have 8 gestures total as a gesture language
---

should be called bridgeenforcer we want to stop using FUSE and use BRIDGER words so the noun is bridge. help me test it and make sure that works and make sure playwright doesn't install chrome it breaks my workflow, use the browser I already have
---

ok, help me clone v1 and create a hot bronze v2 and what I want to do is actually let's simplify, we have 8 ports let's get 1 essential tool per port that is appropriate and each step it logs to the blackboard and it should work in 4 stages/phases called hive base 8
---

so here's the thing I really want to test something, which is to use the stigmergy layer to coordinate the swarm, so I can fire and forget tasks like research and gate them to sections of hfo based on hard gates, my hot/cold medallion para structure so it's a signal refinery. HIVE/8 is a H-POMDP MOSAIC MISSION ENGINEERING PLATFORM with ai swarms and I have alot of proof of concepts but I need hard enforcement because the complexity is too high so the ai agent builders start reward hacking, but once it's built it should be easy to use. I actually want each step and role to be a openrouter llm call with a high performing and cheap model with concurrency. I've already pulsed up to 400 at once and 1000s in batch orchestration, I know I can do it and if I keep it under $0.10/Million token models the prices are very manageable at this scale I need your help to freeze the hub orchestration and clone it and create hub v3. it should be seperate files we track with git and we point the abstraction towards it
---

i want a port 5 integrity to work with port 0 so that low confidence or even dropped frames encage a coasting behavior with snaplock, we assume the user is being clear with their gestures, it's the sensors and mediapipeline limitations, the user's hand doesn't teleport in real life which is why we are adding physics and with physics in port 2 we should also have kinetic lookahead
---

ok I need to test scatter gather pattern for the orchestration hub. this should be under port 7. I think I was doing mastra/temporal/langgraph but we lost alot of that work in generational increment. I want you to help me bootstrap this and log to the mission thread alpha manifest. the goal is to unlock port by port and allow synergy in the MTG SLIVERS flavor format for a MOSAIC JADC2 MOSAIC WARFARE WEB
---

great, make sure that there is no theater, notifying us that something is not yet implemented should be rewarded, thank you
---

there is a weird triple system. please help me with doing a visual inspection and tell me what you see. I do not like the bright green coloring for the hero, we should be red/black with hexagonal hive techno mythical theme
---

Things right now that you need to really help me wire in is that during the initial H hunt step. The eight shards of the observer should be passed over to a summarization and condensation and semantic chunking LLM model in port 7, and then that model creates the handoff baton. So the idea is that the. Agent that's calling for the tools never actually. Has to deal with all the complexity. If they don't want to, they can always audit the artifacts that are created, but they can just ask my system. And then get a. A handoff returned to them. And the ideas that this should be fire and forget so it's like we can have maybe a Damon or something like an auto scheduler watching the. Hot Obsidian blackboard and I can just. Use a specialized format or a standardized format and justice request certain things in a queue using the stigmergy and then the agent can just work off that. Could be like fire and forget doing research tasks. A tools 1 agent 8 to 1 recursive reduction
---

OK, I need you to be careful, but one of the main things I need right now is to expose all the different settings live using LILGUI and in the golden layout panels. Right now I think we have a lot of magic numbers and instead they should be user tunable. And give the control to the user, we'll give them certain defaults. But then we can include a field and then I would like to include. A small little tool tip or a one sentence explanation even. So it will have all these different settings and panels for the user to do with little tool tips of what does what. And best practices and common FAQ issues in the panels. I want to make my system really big, you know, friendly, and the first way to do that is for us to update that. We want to do that in the mission thread Omega manifest. And we can just check it off, do it piece by piece until we have it completely done. I want to avoid theater, so it's really important that if something's a stub or something's A to, do, it screams loudly. It's OK. If you don't do everything at once, hey, I get it. But you need to make sure that you don't lie, that you're not doing it. Just just leave a just leave a note. Be like, hey, this isn't done yet. That's OK. I'm happy with that, but please don't lie to me
---

i need your help with understanding my current version of hfo orchestration hub py. what does it really do right now? show me a matrix what is ready and working what are partial implmementation
---

i think we need to formalize a cursor shape layer under port 2 shaper, what is the visuals we are presenting to the user, we need to make sure it's behind a port and we can hot swap visual on the fly. so video camera skeleton hand shape and w3c pointer injector shape port 2 as well. we'll discuss visual upgrades later, it just needs to be clear and follow good material m3 design so it's mobile and tablet/laptop ready, and it can look nice projected to a big screen so that's why I like golden layout, it's like a nice ide setup and I'm very familiar with it so let's make sure v45 visualizations are correctly hexagonal, and what is passed from port 2 to port 3 injector should be the STRATEGY pattern for visuals so we can hot swap
---

No, what I want you to do is to use the HFO Orchestration hub and help me find a tuning tool that I can use in my mind. You know, there's so many parameters and because we can feed it input and we have telemetry logging, we can do look back. And look ahead for predictive accuracy. In my mind it's like I can use evolutionary tuning, but. We need a tool for that. I can't do this manually. If I write bespoke code, it's gonna get super complex. So please help me look for some tools to help me with tuning the different cursors
---

ok this is close, but this is all HIVE H step, so it's H phase 1 to phase 4. we are not in interlock that's seperate roles port 0 and port 7 are H phase commanders
---

should be called baton Port 0 = synthesis of port 0, and baton port 7 = sythesis of port 7. it's all a fractal architecture, it's holographic so if you see port X in position Y you should be able to infer it's behavior, hfo galoise lattice, jadc2 mosaic tile, trigram, tools etc
---

---

baton port 7 / diamond 2 needs to include bft logic, so 8x port 7 shards, what do we have quorum on and what are the major disagreements, we should not have 100% agreement on everything i am looking for the goldilock mutants where most agree (7/8 is the ideal) for 87.5%~88%. thats the reason it's hfo goldilocks is 88% for 7/8 quorum. but in bft my system should search for 5+ agreement/8
---

we need to add this to the mission thread alpha manifest. when I say port 0 it should instantly be translated for the system as node = ISR = HFO OBSERVE = LIDLESS LEGION = SENSE, same for the other 8 ports, we need a somain language that is based on cognitive framework + mosaic warfare tiles
---

User: My current implementation of mission thread Omega is having some issues with the cursor. Especially the spring physics and the predictive physics cursor are a little weird. They're they're very jittery and they're oscillating even on. Smooth €1. Baselines. So what I want you to do is to help me just use the HFO orchestration hub and help me find out where the real issues are. I want you to create a report into hot bronze. And detail the information for me. Do not write any code. Only create one markdown for me to review and emit signals to the Obsidian blackboard for stick merging coordination.

GitHub Copilot

I think there's more broken implementations more than just a duck DB issue. What I want you to do. Is to help me search through my repo. Use my tools and help me update the Mission Thread Alpha with what are my current gaps, stubs and incorrect implementations. I know we are not ready. I just don't know what the percentage and what the actual breakdown is and that's what I need your help figuring out. I think the AI agents tend to build things. In halves. And then tell me that it's finished but it's like only half done. So I really need your help to discover what is half done even with the agents best attempts. I don't wanna fight this system. I just wanted to tell me it's not done. Like don't lie to me, it's OK. If it's not done, thank you for your work. Now tell me where I can pick up and keep going. Don't just tell me it's done when it's not and then everything collapses later. That's really silly. Just tell me it's not done yet. It's OK
---

working on my hfo orchestration hub, in the port 0 and port 7 batons we need to formalize it as BFT batons instead, so every baton should indicate convergence and divergence and quorum. the targets we have are around 6/8 quorum concensus with a target of 78. we can also mark other convergences but my 8 agent set up should be able to tolerate 3f+1 so we can absorb 2 adverserial nodes in a 8 agent set up
---

error encountered, I think we got rate limited by github copilot. emit blackboard signals and prepare for handoff. update the mission thread manifest with your work and notes for HFO gaps and limitation and issues you see. I want you to be rewarded for identifying stubs and theater. we don't need to take it so personally, we approach it in phases and note the ai likes to skip phases so we just double and triple check and confirm with tools like tamper evident receipts
---

Right now we have a Scala draw working in certain capacities. What I really need is to get an offline version of Piano Genie. And what we'll do is a few specific things with using the W3C pointer so that we can essentially have almost like a touch screen like setup where I can just use my pointer finger on either hand. Two hands, right? So I should have two cursors that I can just enter the button zone of piano Genie and have it play once my system is in a pointer committed state. Which is my gesture for point port 7. Pointer committed gesture. So to start we need to get Piano Genie working in my Omega workspace as like a little window and it should just be able to accept my current mouse inputs. Once we have that tested and working then we'll start layering in my W3C pointer. So that I don't have to use my touch screen. Now I can use my gesture input method. Your main goal right now is to document this into the. Mission Thread Omega manifests and make sure that everything is aligned and we're ready to work on this and download Piano Genie so that we can have it available offline. We do this in phases. We track the phases and we get tamper evident receipts when work is done
---

red tests are great, please note this in the mission thread alpha, red truth is better than green lie
---

emit signal that I keep getting rate limited. I'm running currently 3 gemini 3 flash agents in github copilot. I am prettyy sure github copilot currently only supports me with 1 or 2 agent workshlows, when i go to 3 it rate limits, which is why we are moving to openrouter orchestration which I can easily do pulses of hundreds with cheap llm at affordable rates or i can spam higher reasoning but it gets expensive FAST. make sure you note this and then continue your mission. please coordinate with swarm using the hfo orchestration hub
---

the biggest ADVERSARY HFO has is adversial ISR, agents keep telling me something is ready when it's broken, you can see the adverserial patterns in my repo forensic notes but in general the idea is that VERIFIABLE TRUTH RED > MEANINGLESS GREEN
---

ok i need you to run git ops, we need to make sure HFO knows that we target HFO golilocks 80~99% with a target of 88% for pareto optimal (7/8 87.5%~) and 100% = theater/trivial test and <80% = not good enough yet, evolve more update mission thread alpha manifest, the pareto goldilocks zone is where HFO operates the best at
