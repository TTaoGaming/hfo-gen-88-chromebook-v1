## 🧵 THREAD ALPHA: HFO BOOTSTRAPPING (Orchestration & Governance)

**Current Focus**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.
**Status**: 🟢 **STABILIZED / P5 AUDIT ACTIVE**

### ✅ Key Achievements

- **Gen 88 HFO Grimoire Initialized**: Formalized the lineage and functional architecture of the Phoenix Reconstruction.
- **Port 1 & 2 Hardening**: Port 1 (Hivestone Hub) and Port 2 (Universal Shaper) established as the primary cross-port adapters.
- **32-Card Octal Manifest**: Completed Column 1-4 of the Galois Lattice (Commanders, Equipment, Sagas, Spells) with Tripartite (MTG/Gherkin/JADC2) fidelity.
- **Sacrifice 8 Unified**: Consolidated the scaling mechanic across the entire Grimoire.
- **HFO Hub V8**: Multi-Diamond BFT logic manifold is operational. Consistently reaching ~80% consensus.

### ⚠️ Current Blockers/Risks

- **P5.4 Chronos Fracture**: Immutable unsigned entry at line 2293 of the blackboard. Systemic "Red Truth" signal.
- **Shard 6 Degradation**: Shard 6 (DuckDB) is currently failing/degraded.
- **Adversarial Theater**: BFT Quorum consistently detects "Adversarial Theater" in Shard 0/3.

## 🧵 THREAD OMEGA: TOTAL TOOL VIRTUALIZATION (Gen 4 - Production)

**Current Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation (V18: Matter.js + PixiJS).
**Status**: 🚀 **V17.0 PROMOTED / V18.0 BLUEPRINTING**

### ✅ Key Achievements

- **Omega Gen 4 V20.4**: Promoted with **HFO Trigram Bagua** presets. **FIRE (LI)** implemented as default with **Fixed Standoff** logic to stop oscillation. Includes rising sparks and flicker dynamics.
- **Omega Gen 4 V20.3**: Promoted with **Anatomical Stability Anchor**. Hardened rod against longitudinal bouncing using absolute measures (Index-to-Pinky span) and Palm Cone Angle damping.
- **Omega Gen 4 V20.2**: Promoted with **Nematocyst Injector** (P3). Integrated W3C Pointer event delivery bridge.
- **80/64 Alignment**: Hysteresis thresholds locked at 0.80 (Enter) and 0.64 (Exit).
- **Rigid Rod Physics**: Z-invariant extension fixed at 64% of index finger length.
- **Port 1 Contracts**: Zod-based coordinate fusion verified and integrated.
- **V18 Pivot**: Confirmed **Matter.js** for physics and **PixiJS** for Visual Juice Substrate.

### ⚠️ Current Blockers/Risks

- **V18 Integration**: Transitioning manual MassSpring logic to Matter.js engine.
- **Elemental Juice**: Implementing PixiJS particle emitters and GLSL shaders for fireballs.
- **Rapier Stress Test**: Nightly Stress Event (NSE) pending for comparison against Matter baseline.

## 📍 SYSTEM GROUND TRUTH

- **Active Version**: `omega_gen4_v17.html` (V17.0)
- **Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
- **Defensive State**: Praetorian Immunizer active. P5 Sentinel running.

### 🛰️ Next Operational Step

Execute `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think "QUAD/P0_SENSE_SEARCH: Audit physics coordinates"` to satisfy the P5 Sentinel pre-commit requirement.
