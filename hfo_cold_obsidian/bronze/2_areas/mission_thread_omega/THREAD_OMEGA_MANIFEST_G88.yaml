mission:
  id: "THREAD_OMEGA"
  name: "Total Tool Virtualization & Resource Liberation"
  binary_pair: "THREAD_ALPHA"
  duality: "Yin / Yang | Form / Function | Binary Core"
  status: "FROZEN (v52.0 Cold Bronze)"
  vision: "Intentional Binary Split: Thread Omega (FUNCTION/TOOLS) & Thread Alpha (FORM/ORCHESTRATION). Liberation of All Beings from Resource Constraints through Tool Manifestation. Simple 'Hot Seat' multi-user system with Primacy Seating."
  current_project: "HFO Gen 88 Canalization (V52.0)"
  phase: "HIVE: E (Evolve) - Official Fork Validated"
  insight_v52: "Hot Seat single cursor. First to PORT_7_POINTER_COMMITTED gesture with high confidence gets primacy. Release allows others to pick it up. Sticky release trigger."
  cursor_stabilization_v53:
    release_logic: "Palm Gate Release (Facing Away from Camera). Super easy, high-confidence exit. Tuneable palm cone hysteresis."
    state_visualization: "Transparent-ish 'Idle Cursor' -> POINTER_READY -> COMMITTED."
    snappy_feel: "Leaky Bucket prefill upon recent gesture detection (Anti-Midas Touch). Tuneable pointer-up gesture confidence hysteresis for long press."
    physics_tuning: "Basic Matter.js spring mass dampener with snappy One-Euro based predictive logic. Lock to pointer tip until palm cone release."
    excalidraw_update: "Tuneable opacity for Excalidraw integration."

horizons:
  short_term: "Canalization: W3C Physics Cursor & Gesture FSM (Primacy Seating). 1-Euro default with Inertia Coasting. Sticky fingertip tracking until palm-gate release."
  medium_term: "Virtualization: Tool manifestation warchest; 1:1 functional clones of analog tools."
  long_term: "Liberation: Any child, any tool, any skill. Manifestation through sensor fusion."
