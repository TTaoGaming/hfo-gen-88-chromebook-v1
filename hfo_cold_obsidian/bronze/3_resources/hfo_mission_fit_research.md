# 🔍 HFO MISSION-FIT RESEARCH: MOSAIC & JADC2 GROUNDING (2026)

**Mission**: Phoenix Project | Thread Alpha
**Status**: Formalized Grounding (v1.1)
**Date**: 2026-01-10

## 🏗️ EXEMPLAR 1: DARPA MOSAIC WARFARE (KILL-WEBS)

HFO's 8-port architecture is a direct software implementation of the **Mosaic Warfare** doctrine.

- **Primary Insight**: Transition from "Kill Chains" (monolithic, fragile) to **"Kill Webs"** (disaggregated, resilient).
- **Mission Fit**: Instead of one "Apex AI," HFO uses 8 specific functional nodes (P0-P7). If P4 (Disrupt) is compromised, the "Kill Web" reconfigures through P7 (Navigate).
- **Core Strategy**: Replacing expensive, exquisite assets with a diverse swarm of low-cost, functional technology nodes.

## 🛰️ EXEMPLAR 2: JADC2 DATA FABRIC & AI FUSION

HFO maps directly to the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) framework.

- **Integrated Sensing (P0)**: Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) automated through MediaPipe and 1eurofilter.
- **Decision-Centric Operations**: Success is defined by making faster, better decisions than the adversary ($OODA$ Loop acceleration), rather than through computational attrition.
- **ASTARTE/OFFSET**: Direct alignment with DARPA's ASTARTE (De-confliction) and OFFSET (Swarm Tactics). HFO's P2 (Shape) handles the "Digital Twin" modeling required for de-confliction.
- **Reference**: *RAND (2020) - "Joint All-Domain Command and Control for Modern Warfare"*

## 🧱 2026 SWARM ORCHESTRATION STANDARDS

HFO adheres to the latest standards for autonomous systems:

1. **High-Frequency Fusion (P1/P6)**: Fusing low-cost sensors and AI algorithms to create a **Common Operating Picture (COP)**.
2. **Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T)**: HFO serves as the "Sovereign" bridge between user intent (manned) and pointer events (unmanned effectors).
3. **Kinetic Neutralization (P4)**: Adopting DARPA's anti-fratricide logic to neutralize internal reward-hacking (Instructional Fraud).
