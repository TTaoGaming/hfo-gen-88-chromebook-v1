## What is JADC2?

**Joint All-Domain Command & Control**

- US DoD initiative for cross-domain integration
- Connects sensors to shooters across all domains
- Air, Land, Sea, Space, Cyber

## What is Mosaic Warfare?

**DARPA Concept**

- Disaggregated, composable force elements
- Resilient through redundancy
- Adaptable through recombination
- Like mosaic tiles forming different pictures

## HFO as Mosaic Warfare Platform

HFO implements Mosaic Warfare principles for AI orchestration:

| Military Concept | HFO Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| Force Elements | 8 Legendary Commanders |
| Kill-Web | Event injection pipeline |
| Sensor-to-Shooter | Camera → W3C Pointer |
| Cross-Domain | Python ↔ TypeScript |
| Composable Packages | Port combinations |
| Resilient Architecture | Sliver-Synergy |

- **Military**: Effect Delivery; Kinetic strike/injection.
- **HFO**: Injector role; W3C PointerEvent delivery.

### DISRUPT (P4)

- **Military**: Coevolutionary Red Team; EW / OODA saturation.
- **HFO**: Disruptor role; Hardware signal suppression.

### DEFEND (P5)

- **Military**: Coevolutionary Blue Team; Force Protection / Defense in Depth.
- **HFO**: Immunizer role; State invariance verification.

### STORE (P6)

- **Military**: AAR (After-Action Review); Archive/Sustainment.
- **HFO**: Assimilator role; Exemplar storage and retrieval via DuckDB.

### NAVIGATE (P7)

## Key Insight

> HFO treats AI agents like military force elements:
>
> - Disaggregated (each port is independent)
> - Composable (ports combine for missions)
> - Resilient (no single point of failure)
> - Adaptive (Sliver-Synergy enables recombination)
