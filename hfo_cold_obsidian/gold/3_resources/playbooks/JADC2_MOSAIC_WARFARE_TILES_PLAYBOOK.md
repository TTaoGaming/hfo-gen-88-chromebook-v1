# 🧩 Playbook: JADC2 + DARPA Mosaic Warfare “Tiles” (HFO Alignment)

**Intent:** Use “tiles” as composable mission elements with explicit I/O and assurance boundaries, mapped to HFO ports.

---

## Repo Evidence (Grounded)

- Canon mapping exists in `hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/3_resources/memory/mcp_memory.jsonl` (HFO ↔ JADC2/Mosaic alignment; commander ↔ domain mapping).

## Tile Contract (Minimum)

- Intent, Inputs, Outputs, Assurance (tests/gates/rollback), Degraded mode.

## Port → Tile Role

- P0 ISR; P1 Data Fabric; P2 Digital Twin; P3 Effect Delivery; P4 Coev Red Team; P5 Force Protection; P6 AAR; P7 BMC2.
