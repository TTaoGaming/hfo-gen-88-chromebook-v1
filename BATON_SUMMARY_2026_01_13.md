# 📟 HFO BATON: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY [2026-01-13_0055_UTC]

**Medallion**: Bronze | **Mission**: Phoenix Reconstruction | **Status**: 🔴 RED_TRUTH

## 🚀 MISSION STATUS: OMEGA V10.1 STABILIZED

The project is stabilized at the V10.1 functional baseline. All "88" Pareto-theatrical references have been purged and recalibrated to the **80/64 Alignment**.

### 🛠️ Technical Baseline (Golden Shards)

- **Hysteresis**: 0.80 Enter / 0.64 Exit (Leaky Bucket & Palm Gating).
- **Control**: 64-frame Sparkline Buffers & 64-step Velocity Tracking.
- **Physics**: Rigid Rod Ray anchored at Landmark 8 (Index Tip), Vector from Landmark 5 (MCP).
- **Extension**: `pointerExtensionMultiplier: 0.64` (Z-invariant).

## 🛡️ DEFENSIVE OVERVIEW (PORT 5)

- **P5 Sentinel Daemon**: **RESTORED**. `watchdog` dependency installed; `.vscode/tasks.json` repathed to `.venv/bin/python`.
- **Integrity Status**: **FAIL (Aggregate)**.
- **The Fracture**: P5.4 Chronos fracture at `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` line 2293 remains unsealed. This is an immutable audit record of a signature mismatch.
- **BFT Quorum**: 81.25% Consensus on current mission parameters. [Receipt: `Baton_Port7_20260113_005457`]

## 🧠 FORENSIC AUDIT: AGENT LOOP RESOLUTION

We have successfully analyzed and terminated the **700-line "Analysis Paralysis" loop** detected in the previous session.

- **Diagnosis**: Recursive "Wait, I'll..." triggers caused by cognitive over-coupling between Hunt turning and Execute refinement.
- **Remediation**: Hardened the V10.1 substrate to eliminate the need for agent-side magic-number debate.
- **Documentation**: See [reports/FORENSIC_LOOP_ANALYSIS_V10.md](reports/FORENSIC_LOOP_ANALYSIS_V10.md).

## 🛰️ HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS for HFO-Hive8 (Successor)

1. **Maintain P5 Sentinel**: Do not kill the background task. It is the only thing preventing total canalization failure.
2. **Monitor Shard 6**: P0 Shard 6 (DuckDB) is currently reporting degraded status; investigate memory-locked filesystem conflicts if pointer latency spikes.
3. **Bridge Completion**: Port 1 (FUSE) Zod 6.0 schemas are active but require stress-testing via the **Nightly Stress Event (NSE)** harness.
4. **Visuals**: "Elemental Juice" (fire effects) are currently **DISABLED** for performance benchmarking. Do not restore until V10.1 holds stable under 200% load.

**STIGMERGY SIGNAL**: `MISSION_HANDOFF: V10.1 Stabilized. P5 Sentinel Restored.` logged to blackboard.
