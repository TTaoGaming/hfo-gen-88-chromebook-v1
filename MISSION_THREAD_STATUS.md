# 📟 HFO MISSION THREAD STATUS REPORT [2026-01-13_1010_UTC]
**Medallion**: Bronze | **Mission**: Phoenix Reconstruction | **Status**: 🔴 RED_ALARM

---

## 🧵 THREAD ALPHA: HFO BOOTSTRAPPING (Orchestration & Governance)
**Current Focus**: Hardening the swarm coordination logic and the Medallion flow.
**Status**: 🟢 **STABILIZED / P5 AUDIT ACTIVE**

### ✅ Key Achievements
- **HFO Hub V8**: Multi-Diamond BFT logic manifold is operational. Consistently reaching ~80% consensus.
- **Cognitive Octets**: Sharding task into 8-port cognitive manifold (T0-T7) is standard protocol.
- **P5 Sentinel Restoration**: Sentinel Daemon is now active after dependency repair (`watchdog`).
- **Loop Termination**: Successfully resolved the 700-line "Analysis Paralysis" recursion.

### ⚠️ Current Blockers/Risks
- **P5.4 Chronos Fracture**: Immutable unsigned entry at line 2293 of the blackboard. Systemic "Red Truth" signal.
- **Shard 6 Degradation**: Shard 6 (DuckDB) is currently failing/degraded.
- **Adversarial Theater**: BFT Quorum consistently detects "Adversarial Theater" in Shard 0/3.

## 🧵 THREAD OMEGA: TOTAL TOOL VIRTUALIZATION (Gen 4 - Production)
**Current Focus**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation (MediaPipe + Rapier Physics).
**Status**: 🚀 **V10.1 STABILIZED**

### ✅ Key Achievements
- **Omega Gen 4 V10.1**: Performance-hardened monolith. Removed "Elemental Juice" visuals to prioritize deep visual debugging.
- **80/64 Alignment**: Hysteresis thresholds locked at 0.80 (Enter) and 0.64 (Exit).
- **Rigid Rod Physics**: Z-invariant extension fixed at 64% of index finger length.
- **Port 1 Contracts**: Zod-based coordinate fusion verified and integrated.

### ⚠️ Current Blockers/Risks
- **Visual Regression**: Fire effects currently disabled; pending performance re-validation.
- **Rapier Stress Test**: Nightly Stress Event (NSE) pending to verify FSM stability under noise.

## 📍 SYSTEM GROUND TRUTH
- **Active Version**: `omega_gen4_v10.html` (V10.1)
- **Environment**: Linux on Chromebook (V-1)
- **Defensive State**: Praetorian Immunizer active. P5 Sentinel running.

### 🛰️ Next Operational Step
Execute `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think "QUAD/P0_SENSE_SEARCH: Audit physics coordinates"` to satisfy the P5 Sentinel pre-commit requirement.
