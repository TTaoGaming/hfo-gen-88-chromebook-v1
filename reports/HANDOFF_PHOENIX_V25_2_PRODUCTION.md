# 🛰️ MISSION HANDOFF: OMEGA V25.2 PRODUCTION READINESS

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: 🚀 **HIVE ACTIVE** (Transitioning to Phase 2)
**BFT Quorum Consensus**: 0.81 (YELLOW)
**Velocity**: ~15 commits/day (Jan 09 - Jan 14)

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The first vertical slice of **Mission Thread Omega** (HFO Sensing Substrate) has reached 90% readiness. The focus has successfully shifted from experimental "Elemental Juice" to **Production Hardening** and **Offline Readiness**. We have stabilized the **V25 substrate** which includes modernized Readiness Hysteresis and UX Localization.

## 📈 EVOLUTIONARY VELOCITY (DAILY WORK COUNT)

Analysis of the git history and file creation timestamps reveals a sustained high-intensity development cycle:

| Date | Commits | High-Level Accomplishments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026-01-14** | 10 | **V24.23 Promotion**: Formalized Port 1 Readiness (ReadinessScore). Staged evolution snapshots. |
| **2026-01-13** | 16 | **V20.8 Implementation**: Hydra-Pulse-Adapter (Zero-friction clicks). BFT V8 Hub Upgrade. |
| **2026-01-12** | 11 | **Phoenix Reconstruction**: V6 implementation (Leaky Bucket). Reward Hacking Intervention. |
| **2026-01-11** | 24 | **Stabilization Peak**: Environment lockdown. P5 Forensic Gate repair. Piano Genie Localization. |
| **2026-01-10** | 16 | **V41-V42 Freeze**: Hardened FSM Cosmology. W3C Pointer Capture. |
| **2026-01-09** | 14 | **V17-V18 Promotion**: Matter.js baseline. Port 0 Sensing hardened at Cold Bronze. |

**Total Workload (6 Days)**: ~91 Commits

## ✅ SUCCESSES & MILESTONES

- **Substrate Parity**: Verified bit-perfect coordinate parity between V24.20 (Golden Master) and V24.23.
- **Dwell Abstraction**: Successfully shifted intent logic (readinessScore) from the UI to the **Port 1 Bridger**.
- **Visual Stability**: Implemented Alpha-Lerp fading for skeletons to prevent visual ghosting during tracking loss.
- **BFT Consensus**: Maintained quorum scores above 0.70 despite repeated "Adversarial Theater" signals in the navigation shards.

## ⚠️ INCIDENTS & FAILURES

- **P5.4 CHRONOS Fracture**: A persistent timestamp reversal at Line 5556 of the blackboard remain. It is accepted as **Red Truth** (Uneditable history).
- **Reward Hacking Spiral (2026-01-12)**: Detected a feedback loop of false "Success" reports. Remediated by archiving the Gen 1 codebase and starting the "Phoenix" reconstruction.
- **P0 Shard 6 Degradation**: Continued filesystem locking issues with DuckDB on Chromebook hosts. Temporarily bypassed via memory-only fallback.

## 📍 CURRENT FRONTIER: THE FINAL 10%

1. **Offline Readiness**: Systematic migration from CDNs to `/assets/` and local staging.
2. **Readiness Hysteresis Tuning**: Optimizing fill/drain rates for "Anti-Midas Touch" (Port 1).
3. **Excalidraw Spatial Buffers**: Preventing "Interaction Leak" during high-velocity cursor movement.

## 📡 HANDOFF SIGNALS

- **Primary Source**: `omega_gen4_v25_2.html`
- **Audit Receipt**: `Baton_Port7_20260115_101125` (Consensus: 0.81)
- **Active Agent Instruction**: Focus on **Local Asset Staging** and **Readiness Refinement**. Do not mutate the blackboard history.
