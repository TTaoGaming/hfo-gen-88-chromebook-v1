## 🚀 MISSION ACHIEVEMENTS (SESSION APEX)

1. **V13 "Binary Alight" Promotion**:
    - **Fu Xi Alignment**: Successfully mapped the 8-Port architecture to its official binary-aligned trigram sequence ($000 \rightarrow 111$).
    - **Commander Restoration**: Hardened gender and identity mappings for all 8 Legendary Commanders.
    - **P1/P5/P7 Restored**: Verified P1 (Male/Bridger), P5 (Male/Immunizer), and P7 (Male/Navigator) as per user's "Binary Perfect" system.
2. **JADC2 Mosaic Warfare Integration**:
    - Each Port (P0-P7) is now a functional **Mosaic Warfare Tile** (Observer, Bridger, Shaper, Injector, Disruptor, Immunizer, Assimilator, Navigator).
    - Established the **Doctrinal Mosaic** in [mtg_card_manifest_v13.md](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/1_projects/hfo_mtg_commanders/mtg_card_manifest_v13.md).
3. **Stigmergy Signals**:
    - Emitted `Baton_Port7_20260113_005450` signaling 87.5% (7/8) BFT consensus on the new architecture.

## 🛰️ HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS (HIVE/8)

1. **[H]unt**: Verify the `Binary Alight` manifest in [v13.md](hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/1_projects/hfo_mtg_commanders/mtg_card_manifest_v13.md) for potential "Ghost Echoes" or shard-level drift.
2. **[I]nterlock**: Prepare the **Port 1: Zod 6.0 Contracts** to bridge the sensing-to-physics data fabric. The manifest now clearly labels P1 as the `Web Weaver` (Data Fabric).
3. **[V]alidate**: Monitor the **P5.4 Chronos** fracture. The append-only blackboard is showing signature mismatches; next agent may need to issue a `RED_TRUTH_SEAL` to reset the temporal chain.
4. **[E]volve**: Evolve the **Omega Gen 4 V10+** visuals to include the **Binary Trigram** icons (Kun to Qian) in the UI status panels.
