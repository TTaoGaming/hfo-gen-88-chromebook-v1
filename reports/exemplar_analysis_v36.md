# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: I
# OMEGA V36: EXEMPLAR COMPOSITION BREAKDOWN

## 🎯 Mission Objective
Transition HFO from "bespoke hacks" to "exemplar composition" (best-in-class libraries and patterns) without breaking functional stability (Matter.js favored over Rapier for now).

## 🏗️ Core Piece Analysis

### 1. P0 SENSE: Landmark Smoothing (1€ Filter)
- **Current State**: Inlined `OneEuroFilter` class.
- **Exemplar Status**: The [1€ Filter](http://cristal.univ-lille.fr/~casiez/1euro/) (Casiez et al. 2012) is the industry standard for low-latency human-computer interaction jitter reduction.
- **Analysis**: 
    - Our implementation is "exemplar" in logic but "bespoke" in housing (inlined).
    - **Presets**: 
        - `SX/SY` (Smooth): MinCutoff: 0.5, Beta: 0.001. Optimized for stable targeting.
        - `NX/NY` (Snappy): MinCutoff: 2.0, Beta: 0.1. Optimized for gesture response.
- **Path Forward**: Keep inlined for zero-dependency portability on Chromebook, but verify against the original C++ reference values if jitter persists.

### 2. P1 FUSE: Identity Security (SNN Solver)
- **Current State**: Sticky Nearest Neighbor (SNN) in `omega_workspace_v35.html`.
- **Exemplar Status**: SNN is the preferred "Apex" solution for hand tracking where ID persistence is more valuable than complex bipartite matching (which often causes "Identity Swap" jitter).
- **Analysis**: 
    - Replaces the `Bipartite Solver` which had high cognitive load and failed under rapid occlusion.
- **Path Forward**: Standardize the `teleportLimit` (0.1) and `snapDistance` (0.2) based on MediaPipe FOV.

### 3. P2 SHAPE: Physics Engine (Matter.js)
- **Current State**: `Matter.js` via ESM.
- **Exemplar Status**: The most stable and well-documented 2D physics engine for web substrates.
- **Analysis**:
    - User rejected `Rapier.js` as "breaking." 
    - `Matter.js` provides the `Constraint` system required for the "HFO Spring Cursor" (Pillar 8).
- **Path Forward**: Optimize the `Runner` and `Engine` settings for 60fps on Chromebook V-1.

### 4. P3 DELIVER: Interaction Layer (W3C Events)
- **Current State**: Synthetic `PointerEvent` dispatch.
- **Exemplar Status**: Strict adherence to the [W3C Pointer Events Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents3/) specification.
- **Analysis**:
    - Using `PointerEvent` ensures compatibility with modern UI libraries (React, Excalidraw, etc.).
- **Path Forward**: Ensure `pressure`, `buttons`, and `isPrimary` flags are correctly mapped from the `GestureFSM`.
