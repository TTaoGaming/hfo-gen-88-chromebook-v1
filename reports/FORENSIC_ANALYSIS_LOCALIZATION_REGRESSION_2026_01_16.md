# 🏥 Forensic Analysis: HFO Localization Regression Report

## 🗂️ Metadata

- **Project**: HFO Gen 88 (Phoenix Reconstruction)
- **Incident Date**: 2026-01-16
- **Lead Investigator**: HFO-Hive8
- **Scope**: All localized HTML files (`v28.x` through `v30.x`)
- **Status**: 🔴 REGRESSION IDENTIFIED

## 🔍 Incident Overview

Following the mass localization of dependencies (moving from CDNs to `./lib/`), widespread runtime errors were reported across multiple versions of the application.

### 🛑 Primary Failure: OpenFeature "Nest" Paradox

The transition from the Polyfill.io/CDN-based OpenFeature SDK to the local UMD bundle (`web-sdk.min.js`) changed the global object structure.

- **Old Logic (CDN)**: `window.OpenFeature` was the direct API.
- **New Reality (Local UMD)**: The API is nested at `window.OpenFeature.OpenFeature` or `window.OpenFeature.default`.
- **Symptom**: `TypeError: window.OpenFeature.setProvider is not a function`.

## 🧪 Forensic Evidence

### 1. Version Audit: `omega_gen4_v28_4.html` (FAIL)

- **Audit Tool**: Playwright P5 Console Sentry
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Error**: `🛑 [RUNTIME ERROR]: window.OpenFeature.setProvider is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: The file was patched to use local assets but kept legacy initialization logic that expects a flat global object.

### 2. Version Audit: `omega_gen4_v29_1.html` (PASS)

- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Reason**: This version was manually "Armored" with a robustness check:

  ```javascript
  const api = OF_ROOT.OpenFeature || OF_ROOT.default || OF_ROOT;
  if (typeof api.setProvider === 'function') { ... }
  ```

## 🛠️ Recovery Plan

1. **Unify Initializer**: Apply the "Armored" OpenFeature bridge to all files affected by the localization patch.
2. **ESM Protocol Enforcement**: Document that all localized files **MUST** be served via HTTP (e.g., Port 8888) due to browser restrictions on local `importmap` and ESM modules over `file://`.
3. **Automated Regression Suite**: Expand `tests/p5_console_sentry.spec.ts` to iterate through all active versions to prevent silent breakage.
