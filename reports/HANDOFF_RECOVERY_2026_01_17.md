# 🛰️ HANDOFF REPORT: PHOENIX RECOVERY [2026-01-17]

## 🔴 STATUS: EMERGENCY HANDOFF (STALE WORK DETECTED)

**Medallion**: Bronze | **Mutation**: 0% | **HIVE**: E (Recovery)

---

## 🔍 Incident Summary

The user reported **stale work** and **logic errors** (CHRONOS fractures) in the current workspace. The agent encountered significant friction and was unable to reconcile the state using standard tools.

### 🛠️ Actions Taken

1. **CHRONOS REPAIR**: Executed `scripts/resign_v2.py`.
   - **Result**: Successfully fixed **20+ temporal reversals** in the `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl`, including the critical fracture at line 23705.
   - **Receipt**: `Blackboard successfully re-signed and Chronos fracture resolved.`

2. **STIGMERGY EMISSION**:
   - Tried to run `hfo_orchestration_hub.py think` to log the desync.
   - **Status**: Interrupted via `KeyboardInterrupt` but the repair script has anchored the physical state.

## 📍 Next Steps for Hive-Mind

1. **Ground Context**: The next agent **MUST** run a fresh `Thinking Octet` to synchronize with the repaired blackboard.

   ```bash
   /home/tommytai3/active/hfo_gen_88_chromebook_v_1/.venv/bin/python hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/ports/hfo_orchestration_hub.py think "RECOVERY_SYNC: Synchronizing after Chronos repair."
   ```

2. **Verify V40.2**: The user reported stale work; verify if `omega_gen4_v40_2.html` exists and if the `tests/v40_2_interaction_parity.spec.ts` are ready for execution.

3. **Port 5 Audit**: Run a full Forensic Audit to ensure no "AI Theater" was introduced during the desync.

   ```bash
   /home/tommytai3/active/hfo_gen_88_chromebook_v_1/.venv/bin/python hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/ports/hfo_orchestration_hub.py p5
   ```
