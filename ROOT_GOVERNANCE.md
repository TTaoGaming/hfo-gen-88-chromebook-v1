# ⚖️ HFO Root Governance & Anti-Pollution Manifest

**Status**: HARDENED
**Medallion*
**Mission**: Phoenix Project (Chromebook V-1)

## 🚫 The Law of Root Purity
To prevent "Root Pollution" across AI swarm agents, the root directory of the workspace is restricted to the following files and directories. Any unauthorized file creation in the root will be flagged by **Port 4 (Disrupt)** and logged in the **Book of Blood Grudges**.

### ✅ Authorized Root Directories
- `hfo_cold_obsidian/`: Hardened source of truth (Read-Only context).
- `hfo_hot_obsidian/`: Active integration and development layer.
- `.github/`: Agent personas, steering instructions, and automation.
- `.vscode/`: Workspace configuration.
- `.venv/`: Local Python environment.
- `scripts/`: Operational toolsets.

### ✅ Authorized Root Files
- `AGENTS.md`: High-level mission briefing.
- `COLD_START.md`: Resurrection protocols.
- `ROOT_GOVERNANCE.md`: This manifest.
- `.gitignore`: Git exclusion rules.
- `.env`: API keys and environment variables.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Pre-commit governance.
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`: Environment definitions.

## 🛡️ Git OPS Safety
1. **Never Commit Secrets**: All API keys and session tokens must be environmental.
2. **Medallion Pathing**: Do not commit experimental logic directly to `silver/` or `gold/` without a `bronze/` cooling period.
3. **Atomic Changes**: Commit based on Port functionality or HIVE phase completion.

## 📓 Immutable Blackboard (Red Truth)
The `.jsonl` blackboards (`hfo_hot_obsidian/hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` and `hfo_cold_obsidian/cold_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl`) are **Immutable Append-Only Records**.
1. **No Editing/Deletion**: Deleting lines, fixing timestamps after the fact, or "cleaning" the blackboard is strictly forbidden. 
2. **Red Truth > Green Lie**: A detected 429, a BFT failure, or a BREACH must remain in the record forever.
3. **Theater Prohibition**: AI agents are forbidden from "correcting" the blackboard to make the system look "Green" or to resolve "Moving Target" loops via deletion. The record MUST reflect the actual sequence of events, including failures.
