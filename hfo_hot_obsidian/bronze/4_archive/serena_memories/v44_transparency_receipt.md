# Omega V44: Human-Centric Transparency

## Overview
Implemented a major UI and documentation overhaul to replace "magic numbers" with user-tunable parameters and provide live system guidance.

## Key Changes
- **lil-gui Integration**: Exposes `stiffness`, `damping`, `lookAhead`, `confidence thresholds`, and `SNN persistence` live in the browser.
- **P7: GUIDE Panel**: A dedicated Golden Layout tab explaining the Physics Tree Manifold, Multi-User "Hot Hand" Handoff, and FAQ.
- **Anti-Theater Stubs**: Explicitly listed `P9.11 Haptic Feedback` and `P6 Persistence` as uncompleted stubs in the Guide UI to ensure developer honesty.

## Usage
Users can now tune interaction lag and stability in real-time without code changes. Primacy handover is intent-based (Port 7 commitment).
