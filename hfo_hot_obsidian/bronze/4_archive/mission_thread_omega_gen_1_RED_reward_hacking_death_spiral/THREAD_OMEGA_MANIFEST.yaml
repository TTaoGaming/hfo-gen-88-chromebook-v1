  id: "THREAD_OMEGA"
  name: "Total Tool Virtualization & Resource Liberation"
  binary_pair: "THREAD_ALPHA"
  duality: "Yin / Yang | Form / Function | Binary Core"
  status: "ACTIVE (v55.0 Hot Bronze)"
  vision: "Intentional Binary Split: Thread Omega (FUNCTION/TOOLS) & Thread Alpha (FORM/ORCHESTRATION). Liberation of All Beings from Resource Constraints through Tool Manifestation. Simple 'Hot Seat' multi-user system with Primacy Seating."
  current_project: "HFO Gen 88 Canalization (V55.0)"
  phase: "HIVE: E (Evolve) - Elemental Juice Cleanup & Rebuild"
  insight_v55: "Elemental Juice Refactor (Corrected). Visual fire leaky bucket filling from wrist to fingertips. Fireball cursor for active engagement. Compression-based 'Click/Fire' effect tied to thumb-middle distance. Phase transition cursor. Dissipative release (fade from tip to wrist)."
  elemental_transition_v55:
    compression_logic: "Fireball cursor compression tied to distance between middle finger and thumb. Threshold trigger for CLICK/FIRE explosion effect and phase transition."
    release_logic: "Dwell timer leaky bucket for cursor shrinking. Fire fading from fingertips downwards to wrist on POINTER_7_RELEASE_PENDING (Reverse Ignition)."
  insight_v52: "Hot Seat single cursor. First to PORT_7_POINTER_COMMITTED gesture with high confidence gets primacy. Release allows others to pick it up. Sticky release trigger."
  cursor_stabilization_v53:
    release_logic: "Palm Gate Release (Facing Away from Camera). Super easy, high-confidence exit. Tuneable palm cone hysteresis."
    state_visualization: "Transparent-ish 'Idle Cursor' -> POINTER_READY -> COMMITTED."
    snappy_feel: "Leaky Bucket prefill upon recent gesture detection (Anti-Midas Touch). Tuneable pointer-up gesture confidence hysteresis for long press."
    physics_tuning: "Basic Matter.js spring mass dampener with snappy One-Euro based predictive logic. Lock to pointer tip until palm cone release."
    excalidraw_update: "Tuneable opacity for Excalidraw integration."

horizons:
  short_term: "Canalization: W3C Physics Cursor & Gesture FSM (Primacy Seating). 1-Euro default with Inertia Coasting. Sticky fingertip tracking until palm-gate release."
  medium_term: "Virtualization: Tool manifestation warchest; 1:1 functional clones of analog tools."
  long_term: "Liberation: Any child, any tool, any skill. Manifestation through sensor fusion."
  sensor_fusion_v55: "Lighting Invariant Professional Array: Dual-camera setup (1 Mobile + 1 Thermal). Professional-grade sensing for degraded environments."
