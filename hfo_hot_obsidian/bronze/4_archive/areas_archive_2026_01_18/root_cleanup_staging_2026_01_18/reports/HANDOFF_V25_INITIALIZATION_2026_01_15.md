# 🛰️ HFO Gen 88 Handoff Report: OMEGA V25 Transition

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: 🚀 **HIVE ACTIVE** (Mission Omega: V25 Initialization)
**Agent**: HFO-Hive8

---

## 🏗️ Mission Thread: Thread Omega

**Focus**: Total Tool Virtualization / Hybrid Gesture-Physics Substrate.

### ✅ Achievements (Pre-Handoff)

- **V24 Stabilized**: Confirmed `v24.23` as the hardened "Golden Master" baseline with 1EuroFiltering and W3C event injection.
- **Port 5 Audit**: Verified structural integrity of the `omega_gen4` mission folder.
- **Thinking Octet**: Anchored the mission context to the blackboard (BFT consensus: 0.83).

### 🚀 Target: OMEGA V25

- **Objective**: Transition to V25.0 as the primary development substrate.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Dynamic Hysteresis tuning.
  - Spatial Buffering for edge reachability.
  - Charging Rune visual feedback integration.
  - Performance optimization for Chromebook V-1 hardware.

### 🔴 Red Truth / Known Issues

- **Chronos Fracture**: Persistent temporal reversal detected at line 12087 of the blackboard.
- **Shard Degradation**: Shards 3, 6, and 7 are reporting "Adversarial Theater" signals.
- **V25 Status**: User reports V25 is in a "Red Alarm" state/broken despite parity tests passing. Immediate focus is on functional restoration and tuning.
