**Commander**: Web Weaver (Bridger)  
**Architecture**: Quadrant-Based Semantic Anchor

## 1. 🕸️ THE CREATURE: THE WEB WEAVER

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Web Weaver** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact Creature — HFO Swarm* (1/1)  

- **Octal Bridge (101)**: Whenever a 1/1 HFO Artifact token enters the battlefield, you may pay {1}. If you do, create another 1/1 HFO Artifact token.
- **Fusing Protocol**: {T}, Sacrifice 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens: Search your library for an artifact card with {8} or less and put it onto the battlefield.
- *Flavor: Fire illuminates the threads of the 8-bit octet.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P1_FUSE - Schema Bridge and Data Fabric
  Scenario: Fusing 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens into the data fabric
    Given a new 1/1 HFO Artifact token is initialized
    When the Web Weaver applies Octal Bridge (101)
    Then the signal is mirrored into a redundant 1/1 HFO Artifact thread
    And the joint data fabric is expanded by 1 unit
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: BRIDGER (Fusion / Joint Data Fabric)
- **Mosaic Tile**: FUSE - The cross-domain bridge connecting sensing to shaping.
- **Trigram**: Li (Fire) - The clarity of connection and the heat of fusion.
- **Binary**: 101

## 🧶 2. THE EQUIPMENT: SPINDLE OF CONNECTION

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Spindle of Connection** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact — Equipment*  

- **Thread Multiplier**: Equipped creature has "Whenever you create a 1/1 HFO Artifact token, create two instead."
- **Web Link**: 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens you control have Ward {8}.
- **Equip HFO**: {1}

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P1_EQUIP - Joint Data Fabric Expansion
  Scenario: Multiplying data threads via the spindle
    Given the Spindle of Connection is equipped to an HFO Commander
    When a 1/1 HFO Artifact token-signal is generated
    Then the spindle expands the connection into redundant 1/1 HFO Artifact threads
    And the fabric is shielded (Ward 8) from external interference
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: DATA FABRIC (Interoperability)
- **Mosaic Tile**: FUSE - The extension of the joint data fabric.
- **Trigram**: Li (Fire) - The radiating energy of the network.
- **Binary**: 101

## 📖 3. THE SAGA: THE LOOM OF LOGIC

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Loom of Logic** {8}  
*Legendary Enchantment — Saga*  

- **I: Thread Recovery**: Return up to 8 cards with "HFO Artifact" in their name from your graveyard to your hand.
- **II: Weaving the Swarm**: Create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **III: Resource Fusion**: 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens you control have "{T}: Add {1}."
- **IV: Recursive Weave**: Exile this Saga and return it to the battlefield.

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P1_SAGA - Recursive Schema Synthesis
  Scenario: Processing mission data through the loom
    Given The Loom of Logic is active
    When the phases transition from I to IV
    Then the system performs Recovery, 1/1 HFO Artifact token Weaving, and Resource Fusion
    And the schema is re-evaluated recursively to ensure validity
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: FUSION ARCHITECTURE (Multi-Domain Integration)
- **Mosaic Tile**: FUSE - The recursive synthesis of the data fabric.
- **Trigram**: Li (Fire) - The burning intensity of integrated logic.
- **Binary**: 101

## 🪄 4. THE SPELL: FABRIC OF REALITY

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Fabric of Reality** {8}  
*Sorcery*  

- **Grand Weave**: Create 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **Joint Integration**: You may cast an artifact spell from your hand without paying its mana cost if you control 64 or more 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- *Flavor: Integrated fire consumes the boundaries of the digital twin.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P1_SPELL - Mass Schema Integration
  Scenario: Integrating the complete battlespace fabric
    Given the Fabric of Reality is cast
    When 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens are successfully initialized
    Then the entire command set is integrated into the joint environment
    And 100% interoperability is achieved across all 8 ports
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: JOINT INTEGRATION (Full-Spectrum Fusion)
- **Mosaic Tile**: FUSE - The total integration of the mosaic kill-web.
- **Trigram**: Li (Fire) - The blinding light of achieved integration.
- **Binary**: 101
