  Scenario: Assimilating agent telemetry for future cycles
    Given a token-process has completed its execution cycle
    When the Kraken Keeper processes Octal Storage (110)
    Then the telemetric logs are compressed into the DuckDB data lake
    And the knowledge is indexed across the 8-port knowledge-graph
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: ASSIMILATOR (Post-Mission Analysis / Data Repository)
- **Mosaic Tile**: STORE - The deep ocean of mission history.
- **Trigram**: Dui (Lake) - The repository that holds the harvest.
