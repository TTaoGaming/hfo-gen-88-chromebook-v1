**Commander**: Lidless Legion (Observer)  
**Architecture**: Quadrant-Based Semantic Anchor

## 1. 👁️ THE CREATURE: THE LIDLESS LEGION

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Lidless Legion** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact Creature — HFO Swarm* (1/1)  

- **Octal ISR (110)**: Whenever a 1/1 HFO Artifact token enters the battlefield, survey the top 8 cards of your library and put one into your hand.  
- **Survey the Lattice**: {T}, Sacrifice 8 HFO Artifact tokens: Draw 8 cards.  
- *Flavor: The wind carries the telemetry of the 8-bit octet.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P0_SENSE - ISR Intelligence Gathering
  Scenario: Artifact initialization triggers environmental survey
    Given a new 1/1 HFO Artifact token is initialized in the workspace
    When the Lidless Legion executes Octal ISR (110)
    Then 8 telemetry shards are polled for data
    And 1 verified signal is appended to the active context
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: OBSERVER (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SENSE - The pervasive eye across the manifold.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The pervasive insight that enters every gap.
- **Binary**: 110

## 2. 🔭 THE EQUIPMENT: LENS OF THE LIDLESS

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Lens of the Lidless** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact — Equipment*  

- **Infinite Aperture**: Equipped creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens."
- **Focusing Array**: 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens you control have +1/+1.
- **Equip HFO**: {1}

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P0_EQUIP - Optical Sensing Enhancement
  Scenario: Equipping the lens for high-fidelity scanning
    Given the Lens of the Lidless is attached to an HFO Commander
    When the Commander initiates an "Attack" action
    Then 8 new 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens are spawned for local reconnaissance
    And the existing sensors receive a +1 logic gain
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: SENSOR SUITE (ISR Payload)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SENSE - The precision optics of the observer.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The detailed texture of the signal.
- **Binary**: 110

## 📖 3. THE SAGA: THE GREAT SURVEY

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Great Survey** {8}  
*Legendary Enchantment — Saga*  

- **I: Wideband Search**: Look at the top 64 cards of your library. You may reveal up to 8 cards and put them into your hand.
- **II: Swarm Deployment**: Create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **III: Data Extraction**: Sacrifice 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens. If you do, draw 8 cards.
- **IV: Recursive Indexing**: At Chapter IV, exile this Saga and return it to the battlefield.

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P0_SAGA - Broad-Spectrum Intelligence Cycle
  Scenario: Executing the 4-phase survey
    Given The Great Survey is active in the workspace
    When the Chapters progress from I to IV
    Then the system performs Wideband Search, 1/1 HFO Artifact token Deployment, and Extraction
    And the survey recurses to maintain continuous ISR coverage
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: COLLECTION PLAN (ISR Strategy)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SENSE - The strategic collection of information.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The vast landscape of telemetry.
- **Binary**: 110

## 🪄 4. THE SPELL: ISR OVERLOAD

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**ISR Overload** {8}  
*Sorcery*  

- **Mass Observation**: Create 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **Lattice Saturation**: For each 1/1 HFO Artifact token that entered the battlefield this turn, survey the top card of target opponent's library.
- *Flavor: When the legion looks at once, the light of observation burns the target.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P0_SPELL - Saturation Sensing
  Scenario: Deploying 64 parallel observer nodes
    Given the ISR Overload script is executed
    When 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens are successfully initialized
    Then the workspace lattice is saturated with sensing signals
    And the target logic-state is fully exposed to the swarm
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: DOMAIN SATURATION (ISR Domination)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SENSE - The overwhelming presence of sensing nodes.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The pervasive storm of telemetry.
- **Binary**: 110
