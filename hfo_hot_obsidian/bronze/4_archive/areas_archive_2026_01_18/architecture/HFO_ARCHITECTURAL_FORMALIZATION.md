# 🛡️ HFO ARCHITECTURAL FORMALIZATION: OCTREE MOSAIC

**Mission**: Phoenix Project | Thread Alpha
**Status**: Formalized Grounding (v1.0)
**Pattern**: Octree Polymorphic Hexagonal Logic

---

## 🌀 1. THE MOSAIC PATTERN (DARPA COMPLIANCE)

HFO replaces traditional monolithic "AI Chains" with a **Composable Mosaic Kill-Web**.

- **Composable Tiles**: Each of the 8 Ports (Sense, Fuse, Shape, Deliver, Disrupt, Defend, Store, Navigate) is an independent "tile" with its own adapters.
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Tiles can be hot-swapped or sharded without breaking the global orchestrator.
- **Asymmetric Effects**: The system optimizes for "Mosaic Warfare" – where many small, inexpensive agents/ports create a massive cognitive footprint through coordinated stigmergy.

## 🌳 2. FRACTAL OCTREE CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

To solve the **$O(N^2)$ Context Penalty** of flat swarms, HFO uses a **Fractal Octree Sharding** model.

- **Recursive Depth**: Every cognitive task is sharded into 8 sub-tasks (The Octet). If a sub-task exceeds the context horizon, it is sharded again (Fractal Sharding).
- **Entropy Control**: The Octree structure provides a fixed path ($Log_8 N$) for data retrieval, preventing "Concept Loss" during token saturation.
- **Grounding**: This moves beyond the **Galois Lattice** (which maps relationships) to a **Binary/Octal Spatial Decomposition** of problem sets.

## 🛰️ 3. PORT 7: THE BMC2 ORCHESTRATOR

Port 7 (**NAVIGATE**) is formalized as a **Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2)** node.

- **Strategic Routing**: BMC2 does not perform "Work"; it performs "Orchestration." It determines which Port/Tile is optimal for the current mission state.
- **JADC2 Alignment**: Standardizing on the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) model, where every sensor (Port 0) is connected to every effector (Port 3) through a hardened logic gate (Port 5).
- **Symbolic Linkage**: Port 7 maintains the **Thinking Octet** blackboard, ensuring that every strategic move is logged for forensic auditing ($P5$).
- **Cognitive Mapping**: Logic is directed via the [GRIMOIRE.md](GRIMOIRE.md) matrix (The 8x8 Fractal Quine).
- **Force Composition**: Capabilities are defined by the [16-SLIVER SYNERGY MANIFOLD](../../3_resources/mtg_slivers/16_SLIVER_SYNERGY_MANIFOLD.md), mapping Primary/Secondary sliver archetypes to **Semantic Vectors** for force execution.

## 🧱 5. SEMANTIC VECTOR GROUNDING

HFO defines **Semantic Vectors** as the directional force of a port's capability.

- **High-Velocity Recon (P0)**: Optimized for zero-latency environmental sensing.
- **Universal Interop (P1)**: The hexagonal "Universal Adapter" grounding.
- **Multi-Agent Propagation (P2)**: Recursive sharding and structural synthesis.
- **Hardened Integrity (P5)**: Defensive validation and Medallion flow enforcement.

## 🐝 6. HIVE/8 WORKFLOW (PHASED ORCHESTRATION)

The **HIVE/8 Workflow** is the standardized 4-phase cycle for mission engineering.

| Phase | Symbol | Ports | Function | JADC2 Equiv |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **H** | Hunt | P0, P7 | Sensing & Navigation | OODA (Observe) |
| **I** | Interlock | P1, P6 | Fusion & Storage | OODA (Orient) |
| **V** | Validate | P2, P5 | Shaping & Defense | OODA (Decide) |
| **E** | Evolve | P3, P4 | Delivery & Disruption | OODA (Act) |

- **Port Pairing**: Each phase pairs an active port with a passive port (e.g., P7 Navigator uses P0 Sensors) to create a **Stability Octet**.

## ⚔️ 7. JADC2 MOSAIC WARFARE IMPLEMENTATION

HFO translates high-level military doctrine into physical AI orchestration:

- **ISR (P0)**: Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance → Multi-modal telemetry.
- **Data Fabric (P1)**: Cross-domain integration → Zod 6.0 schema harmonization.
- **Digital Twin (P2)**: Mission modeling → Rapier.js physics substrate.
- **Kill-Web (P3)**: Effect delivery → High-velocity W3C PointerEvent injection.
- **BMC2 (P7)**: Battle Management Command and Control → Spider Sovereign strategic routing.

## 🏗️ MOSAIC TILE COMPOSITION (DARPA GROUNDING)

HFO utilizes **Mosaic Warfare** logic: disaggregated "tiles" of capability that are functionally independent but semantically unified.

### Tile Specifications (The 8-Port Standard)

| Tile | Class | Primary Sliver | Semantic Vector (S.V) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **P0 SENSE** | ISR Node | **Cloudshredder** | [Velocity, Flight, Haste] |
| **P1 FUSE** | Data Fabric | **Manaweft** | [Abstraction, Flow, Scaling] |
| **P2 SHAPE** | Model Twin | **Crystalline** | [Solidarity, Physics, Rigid] |
| **P3 DELIVER** | Kill-Web | **Binding** | [Focus, Event, Capture] |
| **P4 DISRUPT** | EW Module | **Diffusion** | [Noise, Entropy, Suppression] |
| **P5 DEFEND** | Security Gate | **Hivelord** | [Indestructible, Guarded, Strict] |
| **P6 STORE** | Logistics Hub | **Synapse** | [Memory, History, Telemetry] |
| **P7 NAVIGATE** | BMC2 Node | **Sliver Queen** | [Procreation, Strategy, Spawn] |

## 🧩 4. POLYMORPHIC HEXAGONAL PORTS

The "Hexagonal" part of the architecture ensures that HFO is **Technology Agnostic**.

- **Ports**: Stable interfaces defined via **Zod 6.0 Contracts**.
- **Adapters**: Swappable implementations (e.g., P0-Sense can use MediaPipe, OpenCV, or Tavily Search).
- **Integrity**: The **HardGate** ($P5$) validates the semantic and syntax compatibility of any new adapter before it is integrated into the "Cold Obsidian" source of truth.
