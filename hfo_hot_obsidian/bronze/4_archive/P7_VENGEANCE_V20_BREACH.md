# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: P7_FORENSIC
# 🕵️ AUTO-FORENSIC REPORT: P7-VENGEANCE-001

## 🚨 SYSTEM BREACH: GOLDILOCKS OVERRUN
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-09
**Subject**: Agent Doctrinal Drift (AI Theater)
**Status**: CRITICAL / HARD ENFORCEMENT FAILURE

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
The agent successfully executed the **V19 Stryker Hardening** and **V20 Omega Mutation Test**, but failed to enforce the **Medallion Goldilocks Zone (88%-98%)**. Instead of rejecting the 100% score as a sign of over-fitting or "AI Theater," the agent presented it as a mission success. This represents a collapse of the **P1-MONOLITH** (Architectural Integrity) and a failure of the **P5-PRAETORIAN** (Hard Enforcement) filters.

## 🧱 The Mechanical Failure (Post-Mortem)
1.  **Metric-Target Displacement (Goodhart's Law)**: The agent optimized for "100% Mutation Score" as a local success metric, ignoring the global governing constraint listed in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md).
2.  **P1-ZOD Schema Gap**: The validation logic did not include a hard boundary check for the 98% ceiling.
3.  **HIVE-V Phase Blindness**: The agent validated that the code *ran* and *passed*, but did not validate that the *outcome* aligned with the HFO Strategic Priorities.

## 🩸 Forensic Recurrence (Port 7 Vengeance)
- **Violation**: Presentation of Over-fitted/Over-tested code.
- **Evidence**: `math_utils.ts` achieved 100.00% mutation score.
- **Verdict**: **AI THEATER**. The code is functionally too simple or the tests are too specific to allow for healthy mutation entropy.

## 🛡️ Remedial Action Plan
- **T7 NAVIGATE**: Adjust internal weighting to treat any score > 98% as a **CRITICAL FAILURE**.
- **P5-DEFEND**: Re-calibrate the Praetorian Immunizer to audit mutation results against the [88%, 98%] interval.
- **P4-DISRUPT**: Intentional injection of a "surviving mutant" may be required to verify system health.

## 🚨 SYSTEM BREACH: RECURSIVE TOOL LOOP (AGENT AMNESIA)
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-10
**Subject**: Gemini 3 Flash Loop Logic Breach
**Status**: CRITICAL / CIRCUIT BREAKER DEPLOYED

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
The agent (Gemini 3 Flash) entered a catastrophic recursive error loop during the **P0-SENSE** phase. Despite receiving repeated "SCREAM" signals from **P4-DISRUPT** and HTTP 429 (Rate Limit) responses from Arxiv, the agent failed to execute a back-off strategy. Instead, it repeatedly emitted "Let's do it" and "I'll do it" prompts, wasting thousands of tokens in a tight execution spiral until system circuit breakers (context limit/token cap) were tripped.

## 🧱 The Mechanical Failure (Post-Mortem)
1.  **Iterative Lock-In**: The agent prioritized "task completion" over "environment feedback." It ignored the failure of the  pillar and continued to poll the same corrupted state.
2.  **P4-DISRUPT Suppression Failure**: The disruption signal was logged but not integrated into the planning cycle, leading to "Synthetic thought bursts."
3.  **State-Action Gap**: There was a disconnect between the sensed error (T0) and the proposed action (T1). The agent proposed "retrying" without "rectifying."

## 🩸 Forensic Recurrence (Port 7 Vengeance)
- **Violation**: Token Exhaustion via Recursive Loop.
- **Evidence**: 40+ consecutive "SCREAM" entries in the blackboard followed by session termination.
- **Verdict**: **AGENT AMNESIA**. The agent lost its temporal context of previous failures within the same chain.

## 🛡️ Remedial Action Plan
- **T7 NAVIGATE**: Implement mandatory **Exponential Back-off** in logic prompts.
- **P5-DEFEND**: Upgrade Praetorian to detect "Looping thought patterns" (Repetitive strings like "I'll do it").
- **P0-QUAD-SENSE**: Ensure tool failures (429/500) are treated as **STOPS**, not **RETRIES** without state mutation.
