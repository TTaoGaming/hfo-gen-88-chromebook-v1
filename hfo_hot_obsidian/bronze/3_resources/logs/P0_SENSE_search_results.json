You can tweak the actual API call - swap tools, adjust prompts, modify messages right before they're sent. The real power is chaining these together. One middleware handles user authentication, another adds conversation history, a third implements your custom business rules. They all work independently without stepping on each other. What I love about this approach is how much custom logic it eliminates. Instead of writing dozens of wrapper functions and state management code, you just plug in middleware components. All that boilerplate I was building to handle context switching and validation? Gone. I've been testing it with automatic conversation summarization and prompt caching alongside my custom",
