[...] 3) Assessing Existing Test Cases (RQ3): The results ob-tained from analyzing the mutants generated by MUTANDIS on the test cases of SimpleCart and JQUERY library are presented in Table IX. The table shows the number of test cases, number of mutants, number of equivalent mutants, number of non-equivalent mutants, number of mutants de-tected by the test suite (killed mutants), the percentage of non-equivalent mutants and the equivalent mutants, the percentage of non-equivalent surviving mutants, and the mutation score. The percentage of non-equivalent surviving mutants is: #NonEquivSurvivingMutants #T otalNonEquivMuatnts .\nMutation score is used to measure the effectiveness of a test suite in terms of its ability to detect faults .

Using a threshold could encourage developers to maintain and improve the test suite. Commits below a set threshold could be rejected or require motivation for accepting the change without \u201csufficient\u201d testing. A threshold is not always ideal\u2014 enforcing a threshold could result in wasted testing effort for code that does not end up in the final product. It must also be possible to exclude mutants from consideration, e.g., if they are unreachable. Developers should also not be encouraged to \u201ccheat\u201d the threshold (e.g., writing tests centered around specific mutants that add little value to the overall suite). Care must be taken, and the threshold should [...] \u2022 Quality Maintenance: When modifying or extending code, tests should be updated or added to reflect new behavior. Participants suggested using the mutation score to examine the change over time in suite quality. This is especially important for delivered code, where faults not caught by the test suite could impact the customer. It is not just new or changed code that could benefit. Surviving mutants can be seen as technical debt that needs to be reduced through the addition of test cases.\n\u2022 Mutation Score as a Coverage Metric: Similar to line or branch coverage, the mutation score can be calculated for different parts of the code to indicate coverage. A developer can investigate code with low mutation scores to identify problems with how that code is tested. [...] Test Quality: Mutation testing can be used to assess and improve the quality of a test suite.\n\u2022 Verify Test Quality: When developing a test suite, the mutation score can indicate the overall quality of the suite, and live mutants can be used to identify edge cases that have been missed.

        "content": "### Mutation Testing Metrics\n\nMutation Testing provides key metrics that help assess the effectiveness of your test suite and the robustness of your code. These metrics allow you to quantify how well your tests are catching faults (mutants). The most commonly used metrics in mutation testing include:\n\n#### Mutation Testing Score\n\nThe Mutation Score is the primary metric in Mutation Testing, representing the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting mutants.\n\nMutation score = (killed Mutants / Surviving Mutants) \\ 100\n\n Killed Mutants: Mutants that cause the tests to fail, indicating that the test cases detected the mutation.\n Surviving Mutants: Mutants that do not cause the tests to fail, indicating that the test suite failed to detect the mutation.\n\n#### Mutation Coverage [...] Mutation Score: The mutation score is the primary metric that summarizes how well your tests detect the mutants (introduced faults).\n Surviving Mutants: Surviving mutants are mutants that were not detected by your unit tests (i.e., your tests passed even after the mutations were introduced).\n Killed Mutants: Killed mutants are mutants that were detected and killed by your unit tests (i.e., your tests failed when the mutants were introduced).\n Mutation Testing Time: Mutation testing tools can be time-consuming as they create many mutants and execute tests against them. The time it takes to generate mutants and run the tests can be an important metric.\n\n### Common Errors in Mutation Testing [...] Test Quality Evaluation: It helps to identify the weak or missing test cases. It covers the edge cases that may not be covered under traditional testing. Ensures that testing doesn\u2019t cover the code but also the expected validations.\n Mutant Creation: You need to introduce small changes in the code, which can be arithmetic, logical, or any kind of coding change.\n Mutation Score Detection: One can evaluate this testing with a simple below formula, Mutation score = (Mutants killed / total mutants) \\ 100  \n  Here, \u2018mutants killed\u2019 represents the number of defects detected by the test case, and total mutants represent the number of changes made inside the code.",

        "content": "This study distinguishes between generated mutants and covered mutants. A test is said to cover a mutant if it reaches and executes the mutated code. While the number of generated mutants is test-independent and re\ufb02ects the complexity and structure of the mutated program, the number of covered mutants always depends on a given test suite. The mutation score S is usually de\ufb01ned as the ratio of number of detected mutants to the number of generated mutants. Taking mutation coverage information into account, a more detailed view on the mutation score is S = C \u2217S C where C denotes the mutation coverage ratio and S C represents the mutation score with respect to the number of covered mutants . This separation o\ufb00ers a better view on the two aspects of test e\ufb00ectiveness \u2014 that is, test coverage [...] mutants \u2014 that is, the number of detected mutants divided by the number of covered mutants. Table VII gives the mutation scores for the test suites Tdev and Tgen when using the set of all mutants Mall and the reduced set of mutants Mred. When applying the reduced set of mutants, the mutation score decreases for all test suites with an overall decrease of 5% for Tdev and 11% for Tgen. [...] 1. INTRODUCTION Originally introduced by Budd  and DeMillo , mutation analysis measures the e\ufb00ectiveness of a testing or debugging technique based on arti\ufb01cial faults that are systematically seeded into a program under test (the original program). Each of those seeded faults leads to a small syntactic variation of the original program, called mutant. The syntactic change within such a mutant is referred to as mutation, which is produced by a mutation operator. E\ufb00ectiveness is quanti\ufb01ed in the mutation score, which is the percentage of mutants that a test can distinguish from the original program. A test that can distinguish a mutant from the original program is said to detect that mutant.",
