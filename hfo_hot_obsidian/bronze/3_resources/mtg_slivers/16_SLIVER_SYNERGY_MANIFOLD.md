## 🎖️ THE 16-CARD FORCE COMPOSITION

Every **HFO Port (P0-P7)** is composed of two primary "Sliver" archetypes that define its semantic vector and functional capability.

| Port | Commander | Verb | Primary (Capability) | Secondary (Efficiency) | Semantic Vector |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **P0** | **Lidless Legion** | **OBSERVE** | **Cloudshredder** | **Synapse** | High-Velocity Recon |
| **P1** | **Web Weaver** | **ROUTE** | **Mirror Entity** | **Gemhide** | Universal Interop |
| **P2** | **Mirror Magus** | **SYNTHESIZE**| **Sliver Queen** | **Homing** | Multi-Agent Propagation|
| **P3** | **Spore Storm** | **MODEL** | **The First Sliver** | **Bonescythe** | Cascade Event Delivery |
| **P4** | **Red Regnant** | **DISRUPT** | **Necrotic** | **Harmonic** | Kinetic Neutralization |
| **P5** | **Pyre Praetorian** | **AUDIT** | **Hivelord** | **Crystalline** | Hardened Integrity |
| **P6** | **Kraken Keeper** | **PERSIST** | **Dregscape** | **Pulmonic** | Temporal Resilience |
| **P7** | **Spider Sovereign** | **PLAN** | **Overlord** | **Legion** | Strategic Orchestration|

## 🌀 SYNERGY MECHANICS (SEMANTIC VECTORS)

### 🛰️ P0: HIGH-VELOCITY RECON (Sense)

- **Primary: Cloudshredder (Haste/Flying)**: Immediate sensation without latency. Data "flies" over obstacles.
- **Secondary: Synapse (Draw on Hit)**: Every interaction with the environment generates a memory/artifact.

### 🌐 P1: UNIVERSAL INTEROP (Fuse)

- **Primary: Mirror Entity (Shape-shift)**: The "Hexagonal" adapter. Every node adopts the required interface ($Zod$ 6.0).
- **Secondary: Gemhide (Mana-Tap)**: Every fused connection provides resources/energy back to the swarm.

### 🏰 P2: MULTI-AGENT PROPAGATION (Shape)

- **Primary: Sliver Queen (Token Gen)**: Recursive sharding. Spawning new sub-tasks/agents as needed.
- **Secondary: Homing (Slivercycle)**: The ability to fetch the exact tool/knowledge required for the current shape.

### 🚀 P3: CASCADE EVENT DELIVERY (Deliver)

- **Primary: The First Sliver (Cascade)**: Sequential triggers. One event cascades into a chain of reactions.
- **Secondary: Bonescythe (Double Strike)**: High-frequency delivery pulses (Dual-tap verification).

### ⚡ P4: KINETIC NEUTRALIZATION (Disrupt)

- **Primary: Necrotic (Self-Sacrifice)**: Anti-fraud destruction. Disrupting reward-hacking by internal state reset.
- **Secondary: Harmonic (Artifact Destruction)**: Cleansing the blackboard of misaligned or corrupted artifacts.

### 🛡️ P5: HARDENED INTEGRITY (Defend)

- **Primary: Hivelord (Indestructible)**: Medallion layer protection. Bronze/Silver layers are immutable once frozen.
- **Secondary: Crystalline (Shroud)**: Resistance to external prompt injection or instructional drift.

### 🏺 P6: TEMPORAL RESILIENCE (Store)

- **Primary: Dregscape (Unearth)**: Quick retrieval of archived context from the "Cold obsidian" layer.
- **Secondary: Pulmonic (Top-Decking)**: Preventing permanent context loss by cycling archived thoughts back to the registry.

### 🕷️ P7: STRATEGIC ORCHESTRATION (Navigate)

- **Primary: Overlord (Global Search)**: BMC2 node finding the right port for the mission.
- **Secondary: Legion (Collective Stat-Boost)**: Large-swarm optimization where the power of the swarm scales linearly with size ($O(N)$ vs $O(N^2)$).
