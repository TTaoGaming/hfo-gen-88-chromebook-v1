  doctrine: JADC2 C2 Node
  scope_rule: "Infrastructure == Alpha. Product/gesture/UI payload == Omega. If ambiguous, treat as Alpha."

project:
  name: hfo_alpha_hub
  layer: hot_bronze
  created: 2026-01-24
  purpose: >-
    Provide a single fail-close entryway for infrastructure work: stable root shims,
    MCP gateway tooling, contracts, receipts, and audit-grade observability.

entry_surfaces:
  root_shims:
    - hfo_hub.py
    - hfo_mcp_gateway_hub.py
  alpha_gateway_impl:
    - hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/1_projects/alpha_mcp_gateway_hub/hfo_mcp_gateway_hub.py

constraints:
  - all tool actions should flow through a blessed entry surface (root shim or gateway)
  - fail-close boundaries: missing contracts/receipts must block progress (no silent bypass)
  - blackboard is append-only audit log (chained signatures + monotonic timestamps)
  - contracts are the interface: cross-port data must be schema-validated
  - observability must be default: emit invoke/result signals on every wrapper use

observability:
  audit_bus:
    file: hfo_hot_obsidian/hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl
    envelope: CloudEvents-ish
    required_fields:
      - type
      - time
      - source
      - data
      - signature
      - timestamp
    tracing:
      w3c_traceparent: true
      required_fields:
        - trace_id
        - span_id
        - traceparent
    taxonomy:
      required_pairs:
        - invoke
        - result
      examples:
        - hfo.hub.invoke
        - hfo.hub.result
        - hfo.playwright.invoke
        - hfo.playwright.result

interfaces:
  ports:
    p0_observe: "External sensing + search + context retrieval"
    p1_bridge: "Schema/contract bridge + tool routing"
    p2_shape: "Physics/geometry shaping and validation"
    p3_inject: "Controlled effect delivery and dispatch"
    p4_disrupt: "Adversarial checks + fuzzing gates"
    p5_immunize: "Audits, receipts, integrity gates"
    p6_assimilate: "Storage/journal queries/rollups"
    p7_navigate: "Orchestration + sequential reasoning"

contracts:
  zod_contracts_dir: contracts/
  rule: "All cross-port payloads must be validated by Zod (TS) or equivalent checks (Py)"
  current_contracts:
    - contracts/hfo_pointer_command.zod.ts
    - contracts/hfo_tripwire_events.zod.ts

fail_close_gates:
  blackboard:
    check_only_gate: scripts/blackboard_purity.py --check-only
    invariants:
      - chained_signature
      - monotonic_timestamp
      - jsonl_well_formed
  p5_forensics:
    command: hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/4_archive/areas_archive_2026_01_18/architecture/ports/hfo_orchestration_hub.py p5
  precommit:
    command: scripts/hfo_precommit_gate.sh

acceptance:
  - "Every run of hfo_hub.py emits invoke+result events to the hot blackboard"
  - "Every run of scripts/hfo_playwright_safe_run.py emits invoke+result events to the hot blackboard"
  - "Blackboard purity check-only passes when writers are stopped and manifest is fresh"
  - "P5 forensics passes (warnings allowed for legacy archives, but no BREACH)"
  - "Contracts in contracts/ remain the SSOT for cross-port payloads"

red_tests_plan:
  - "Tamper with a blackboard line -> purity gate detects breach"
  - "Remove a required receipt -> gateway blocks commit"
  - "Emit malformed event -> schema validator fails (future hardening)"

non_goals:
  - refactor omega gesture logic
  - change blackboard signature rules
  - bypass contracts/receipts enforcement
