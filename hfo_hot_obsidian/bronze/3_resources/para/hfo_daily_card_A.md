Goal: coverage • Rule: max 3 • Example: work, health_admin, people_learning_play
- area_1: work
- area_2: health_admin
- area_3: people_learning_play

## 2) Define outcomes (verb + object)
Goal: measurable finish • Rule: 1 line each • Example: ship draft, book appointment
- outcome_1: ship client outline
- outcome_2: book dentist appointment

## 5) Gherkin (implementation intention)
Goal: if‑then plan • Rule: 3 lines • Example: If 9am then outline
Scenario:
  Given 9:00am and desk clear
  When I open the outline doc
  Then I write 200 words
  And if blocked, Then outline bullets only

## 6) WOOP (micro)
Goal: mental contrast • Rule: 1 line each • Example: wish=focus, obstacle=phone
