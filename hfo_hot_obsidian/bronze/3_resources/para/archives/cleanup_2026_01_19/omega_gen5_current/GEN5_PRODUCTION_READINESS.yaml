project: Omega Gen5
focus: production_readiness
process:
  - phase: research
    goal: compile requirements and risks
    artifacts:
      - VIDEO_PIPELINE.md
      - forensics/gen5_vs_gen4_v40_1_diff_report_2026_01_19.md
      - stigmergy/harness_blackboard.jsonl
  - phase: tdd_red
    goal: write failing tests for required behaviors
    harnesses:
      - scripts/omega_gen5_video_fsm.spec.ts
      - scripts/omega_golden_master_replay.spec.ts
  - phase: tdd_green
    goal: make tests pass with minimal changes
  - phase: tdd_refactor
    goal: harden, simplify, document
requirements:
  reliability:
    - deterministic golden-master JSONL replay
    - FSM sequence validation (IDLE→READY→COMMIT→IDLE)
    - pointer injection parity across targets
  performance:
    - stable frame time under target fps
    - bounded latency for gesture-to-pointer
  safety:
    - graceful camera permission failures
    - WebGL fallback without crashes
  compatibility:
    - mirror mode parity (including handedness)
    - same-origin iframe handling
  governance:
    - P5 audit pass before promotion
    - receipts for clips/JSONL in silver
status:
  research:
    tavily_search: unavailable (missing TAVILY_API_KEY)
    evidence_basis: repo artifacts only
hypothesis:
  claim: "composition of exemplars implies Pareto frontier"
  assessment: unverified without external benchmarks or comparative evaluations
next_actions:
  - add performance probe with thresholds
  - add pointer-injection parity tests
  - document camera/webgl failure modes
