# Daily Card — Version C (Tip Callouts)

## 1) Pick 3 areas
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Coverage without overload. Max 3, one word each. Example: work, health_admin, people_learning_play.
- area_1: work
- area_2: health_admin
- area_3: people_learning_play

## 2) Define outcomes (verb + object)
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Clear finish lines. Verb + object. Example: ship outline, book appointment, read 10 pages.
- outcome_1: ship client outline
- outcome_2: book dentist appointment
- outcome_3: read 10 pages

## 3) Smallest next actions (2–5 min)
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Reduce friction. Starter steps only. Example: open doc, send text, set timer.
- action_1: open outline doc
- action_2: text dentist office
- action_3: set 10‑page timer

## 4) Time anchor + MVP
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Protect focus. One block + MVP. Example: 9:00–9:45 deep work; MVP=outline v1.
- anchor_label: 9:00–9:45 deep work
- anchor_minutes: 45
- daily_mvp: finish outline v1

## 5) Gherkin (implementation intention)
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> If‑then plan. Given/When/Then + fallback. Example: Given 9am → When open doc → Then write 200 words.
Scenario:
  Given 9:00am and desk clear
  When I open the outline doc
  Then I write 200 words
  And if blocked, Then outline bullets only

## 6) WOOP (micro)
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Mental contrast. One line each. Example: wish=finish, obstacle=phone, plan=phone away.
- woop_wish: finish outline
- woop_outcome: send to client
- woop_obstacle: phone distractions
- woop_plan: phone in another room

## 7) End‑of‑day review (scores 1–5)
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Fast reflection. 3 scores + 1–2 wins. Example: 4/3/4; win=outline done.
- score_work: 4
- score_health_admin: 3
- score_people_learning_play: 4
- win_1: outline done
- win_2: appointment booked

## 8) GTD status
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Stage clarity. One word + next action. Example: clarify; email client v1.
- gtd_status: clarify
- gtd_next_action: email client v1
- gtd_context: desk

## 9) Sources
> [!tip] Why/How/Example
> Grounding. 1–3 refs + note. Example: brief link + constraints.
