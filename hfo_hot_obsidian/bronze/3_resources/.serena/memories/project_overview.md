# HFO Gen 88: Project Purpose & Overview
The Hyper-Fractal Obsidian (HFO) project is an Apex Ensemble Mosaic Warfare Mission Engineering Platform. Its primary goal is the "Phoenix Project" – reconstructing HFO on a Linux-based Chromebook (V-1).
The project virtualizes human interaction through a high-fidelity **Physics Cursor**, bridging physical sensing (MediaPipe) with virtual substrates (W3C Pointer Events).

## Mission Threads
- **Thread Alpha (HFO Bootstrapping)**: AI Orchestration, JADC2 Mosaic Warfare, Galois Lattice mapping.
- **Thread Omega (Total Tool Virtualization)**: High-fidelity virtual tool creation (e.g., MediaPipe/Camera → W3C Pointer).
