# Kraken Keeper Postflight (P6)

- scope: P6
- preflight_receipt_id: cae45010d66d
- postflight_receipt_id: cfe2204b9925

## Objective
- Hello Kraken Keeper. In one paragraph: what can you do/can\x27t you do, and can you access Jan 2025 to now?

## AAR
- Outcome: **ok**
- Summary: Chat answer delivered; operator reports written (see Hot/Bronze markdown).

## Answer (operator-facing)
I can read and write files inside this current workspace, run the repo’s scripts/tasks, and create auditable artifacts (receipts + reports) following your preflight→report→postflight ritual. I can’t automatically see anything outside this workspace (so I do not inherently have all Jan 2025→now history unless it’s present here), and I won’t treat unsourced claims as true—missing evidence gets labeled and turned into the next smallest proof step.
