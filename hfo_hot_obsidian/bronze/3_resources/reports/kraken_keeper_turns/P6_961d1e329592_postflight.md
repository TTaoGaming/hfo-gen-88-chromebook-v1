- postflight_summary: None

## Operator note
- The JSON answer was returned in the Copilot chat turn; this report is the 1-page durable stub tied to the receipts.
- If you want the full answer stored durably, re-run the turn via scripts/kraken_keeper_turn.py so the driver writes the answer into this postflight markdown automatically.
