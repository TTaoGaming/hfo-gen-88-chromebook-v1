## 🎯 Critical Path Actions

1. **Envelope Formalization (FUSE)**: Wrap every message in a [CloudEvent](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) envelope with trace context.
2. **Physics Integration (SHAPE)**: Pivot from simple smoothing to a Rapier-driven Mass-Spring-Dampener model.
3. **Fail-Closed Teardown (DEFEND)**: Implement a P5-Monitor that triggers the W3C `pointercancel` event on tracking loss.
