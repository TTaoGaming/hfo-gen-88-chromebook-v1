- **{T}, Sacrifice $8^1$ Agents**: Scry $8^1$, then Draw $8^1$.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given a high-dimensional and noisy environment manifold
When the $8^1$ sensing shards witness the lattice state
Then return verified telemetry landmarks to the Kraken Keeper
```

- **Schema Bridge**: HFO creatures you control have Ward {$8^1$}.
- **Interlock {$8^0$}**: Bridge P$8^0-8^0$ telemetry to P$8^0+8^0$ physics by changing target HFO creature's color identity until end of turn.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given multi-modal sensor streams from the Lidless Legion
When the web weaver translates chords via Zod $8^1-(8^0+8^0).0$ contracts
Then output a unified and type-safe data fabric bridge
```

### [P$8^0+8^0$] THE MIRROR MAGUS (SHAPE)
>
> **Trigram**: Kan ☵ (Water) | **JADC2**: Digital Twin (Shaper) | **HIVE**: VALIDATE (V)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)

- **Matter Synthesis**: Non-creature HFO permanents are HFO creatures in addition to their other types (Power/Toughness = $8^0/8^0$).
- **Polymorphic Shape**: {X}: Mirror Magus becomes a copy of target HFO permanent until end of turn.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given a target digital twin and a physics manifold
When the magus synthesizes state via Rapier Wasm kernels
Then achieve structural parity between virtual and physical
```

### [P$8^0+8^0+8^0$] HARMONIC HYDRA (INJECT)
>
> **Trigram**: Xun ☴ (Wind) | **JADC2**: Effect Dispatch (Injector) | **HIVE**: EVOLVE (E)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)

- **Cascading Payload**: HFO spells you cast have Cascade.
- **Hydra Vulgaris (Budding)**: Harmonic Hydra enters with $8^1$ head counters. If one head counter is removed, create $8^0+8^0$ head counters at the next upkeep.
- **Immortality (Regen)**: Harmonic Hydra has Indestructible as long as it has $8^1$ or more head counters.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given a pending effect stack and a target state-action
When the harmonic hydra injects cascading event buds
Then trigger $8^1$ parallel FSM transitions without latency
```

- **OODA Strife**: {$8^0+8^0$}: Create $8^0$ creature $8^0/8^0$ HFO Agent token.
- **Cull the Weak**: Sacrifice an Agent: Target opponent discards $8^0$ card. If they cannot, they lose $8^1$ life.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given an adversarial cycle or a frozen terminal loop
When the red regnant disrupts the feedback resonance
Then cull stale agents and release mutation fuel
```

### [P$8^1-(8^0+8^0+8^0)$] PYRE PRAETORIAN (IMMUNIZE)
>
> **Trigram**: Li ☲ (Fire) | **JADC2**: Force Protection (Immunizer) | **HIVE**: VALIDATE (V)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)

- **Dance of Rebirth**: Whenever an HFO card is put into a graveyard from anywhere, you may pay $8^1$ life to return it to exile.
- **HardGate Audit**: HFO cards you own in exile have Escape (Pay {$8^1$} and exile $8^1$ other cards).

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
Given an unverified code fragment in the Bronze layer
When the praetorian immunizes the manifold via audit
Then promote the fragment to Silver or burn it to ash
```

### [P$8^1-(8^0+8^0)$] KRAKEN KEEPER (ASSIMILATE)
>
> **Trigram**: Dui ☱ (Lake) | **JADC2**: Logistics / Sustain (Assimilator) | **HIVE**: INTERLOCK (I)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)

- **Datalake Depth**: Whenever you cast an HFO spell, put $8^0$ Knowledge counter on Kraken Keeper.
- **Assimilation**: {T}, Remove $8^2$ Knowledge counters: Search your library for any HFO card and put it onto the battlefield.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)

```gherkin
