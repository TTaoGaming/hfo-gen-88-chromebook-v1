# 🎭 HFO_ALPHA_UNIFIED_MANIFEST: THE PHOENIX STRATEGEM (V8.1.0)

**Mission Thread Alpha**: HFO Bootstrapping (Orchestration/Mosaic Warfare)
**Current Date**: 2026-01-16
**Status**: 🌋 **PHOENIX ARMORED** (Post-Sterilization Rebirth)

---

## 🏗️ 1. ARCHITECTURAL SSOT: HEXAGONAL MOSAIC

The HFO Orchestration Hub has transitioned from monolithic stubs to a **Hexagonal Port & Adapter Architecture**. This is the substrate upon which the "Human-as-Swarm" paradigm is manifest.

- **The Hex Core**: Decoupled `HubCore` managing the `ScatterGather` protocol (8-1-8-1 BFT).
- **The Ports**:
  - `PersistencePort`: Mediating between the `.jsonl` blackboard and future DuckDB/Parquet event stores.
  - `LLMPort`: Bridging OpenRouter shards with strict "Adversarial Theater" detection.
- **The Pipeline**: `HUNT -> INTERLOCK -> VALIDATE -> EVOLVE`.

## 🧵 2. MISSION THREAD ALPHA: CORE OBJECTIVES

### 🕷️ A. The Sovereign Navigator (Port 7)

Unification of the **Spider Sovereign** (Lord of Webs) with the 24/7 daemon substrate.

- **Goal**: Transition from "Session-based" agentic thinking to "Persistent" mission engineering.
- **Mechanism**: The `hfo_spider_sovereign_daemon.py` acts as the persistent pulse, consuming pheromones from the blackboard to steer the 8-Port Swarm.

### 🧩 B. Mosaic Warfare (JADC2 Alignment)

Implementation of DARPA-inspired Mosaic Warfare tiles as composable capability shards.

- **Sense (P0)**: ISR/Relay/Fuse/Simul/SEAD/Trace/Cache/Hunt.
- **Navigate (P7)**: Map/C2/Sync/Logic/Warp/Vote/Memo/BMC2.

## 🚀 3. THE STRANGE LOOP: AKKA/MCP REFACTOR (V1.0)

Current project state is transitioning to the **Akka Agentic Platform** (System 2) and **Model Context Protocol** (System 1).

### 🛡️ Phase 1: Hardened Base (Bootstrap)

- **Actor Model**: Implementing `HardenedBaseActor` for stateful determinism.
- **Event Sourcing**: Using DuckDB to persist every "Pulse" of the swarm, allowing temporal rewinds and forensic audits.
- **MCP Integration**: Standardizing tool access (Tavily, Brave, Filesystem) via the Model Context Protocol to eliminate "Tool Friction."

### 🌀 Phase 2: Double Diamond Resonance

- **BFT Interlock**: Hub V8 (Akka) will block execution if consensus score < 0.35, preventing reward-hacking death spirals.
- **Strange Loop Intervener**: Linking Port 4 (Disrupt) violations to Port 5 (Defend) pyre cycles.
