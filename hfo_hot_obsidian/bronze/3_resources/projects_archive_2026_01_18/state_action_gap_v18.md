# 📊 HFO State-Action-Gap Analysis: V18 Ensemble Cursor

**Context**: Post-V18 Refactor (5-Cursor UI) vs. Total Tool Virtualization (Thread Omega End-State).
**Date**: 2026-01-09

## 🏗️ State-Action-Gap Matrix (V18 -> Ideal)

| Dimension | [V18] Current State (Hardened) | [Ideal] Omega End-State Status | The Gap (Action Space) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0 SENSE** | GestureRecognizer (MediaPipe) | Multi-Hand / Multi-Modal Sensing | Add support for 2nd hand & depth-sensing. |
| **P1 BRIDGE** | Local State (Plain JS Objects) | Zod 6.0 Contracts / IPC Bridge | Wrap 5-cursor frames in Zod schemas. |
| **P2 SHAPE** | Matter.js (2D Rigid Body) | Full W3C Physical Twin (Rapier 2D/3D) | Re-attempt Rapier or harden Matter.js 3D. |
| **P3 DELIVER** | Rendering Loop (Canvas Only) | W3C Pointer Event Injection | Bridge Matter.js -> real Browser Events. |
| **P4 DISRUPT** | Smoke Tests (Playwright) | Stryker Mutation Scoring (>88%) | Run Stryker on the JS physics engine logic. |
| **P5 DEFEND** | Manual Commit Sentinels | Automated Resurrection / P5-Monitor | Automate pointercancel on tracking drift. |
| **P6 STORE** | Blackboard Log Shards | DuckDB Telemetry Analysis | Pipe cursor jitter data to Port 6 Store. |
| **P7 NAVIGATE** | Agent-Steered Refactoring | Autonomous Tool Generation | Build V19 Tool-Broker with the cursor. |

## 🚀 Key Strategy: The Injection Breach
The primary gap in V18 is that the physics cursors (Spring/Predictive) exist only in the **Visual Substrate** (Canvas). They are not yet performing **Functional Injection** into other apps (Excalidraw/Piano Genie).

### High Priority Actions (V19):
1. **P3 DELIVER**: Map Matter.js body positions to 'new PointerEvent(pointermove)'.
2. **P1 FUSE**: Define the CursorFrame Zod contract to prevent data pollution between anchors.
3. **P6 STORE**: Initialize DuckDB to track the State-Action Gap efficiency (latency vs. accuracy).
