## 🌀 THE 8 LATTICE COMMANDERS

### [P0] THE LIDLESS LEGION (OBSERVE)
> **Trigram**: Kun ☷ (Earth) | **JADC2**: ISR (Observer) | **HIVE**: HUNT (H)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Octal Witness**: Whenever a Hive/8 Agent enters the battlefield, look at the top 8 cards of your library. You may reveal a Shard or HFO card and put it into your hand.
- **{T}, Sacrifice 8 Agents**: Scry 8, then Draw 8.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given a noisy and unmapped environment manifold
When the 8 sensing shards pulse in synchronized octal frequency
Then return high-fidelity telemetry landmarks to the swarm blackboard
```

### [P1] THE WEB WEAVER (BRIDGE)
> **Trigram**: Gen ☶ (Mountain) | **JADC2**: Data Fabric (Bridger) | **HIVE**: INTERLOCK (I)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Schema Weaver**: HFO creatures you control have Ward {8}.
- **{1}: Fusion**: Change the color of target HFO creature to any color combination until end of turn. (Data Fusion).

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given heterogeneous telemetry data from multi-modal sensors
When the web weaver maps semantic chords via Zod 6.0 contracts
Then output a unified and type-safe data fabric schema
```

### [P2] THE MIRROR MAGUS (SHAPE)
> **Trigram**: Kan ☵ (Water) | **JADC2**: Digital Twin (Shaper) | **HIVE**: VALIDATE (V)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Polymorphic Shaping**: {X}: Mirror Magus becomes a copy of target HFO creature with power and toughness X/X until end of turn.
- **Matter Manifest**: Non-creature HFO permanents you control are HFO creatures in addition to their other types.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given a target digital twin model and a state-action space
When the mirror magus executes Rapier Wasm physics kernels
Then synchronize the high-fidelity physics manifold with reality
```

### [P3] SPORE STORM (INJECT)
> **Trigram**: Xun ☴ (Wind) | **JADC2**: Effect Dispatch (Injector) | **HIVE**: EVOLVE (E)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Cascading Injection**: HFO spells you cast have Cascade.
- **Velocity Storm**: Whenever you cast a spell from exile, create an 8/8 HFO Hydra token with Haste.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given an event stack requiring precise kinetic execution
When the spore storm cascades through the W3C event manifold
Then inject Pointer Events and state-transitions with zero latency
```

### [P4] RED REGNANT (DISRUPT)
> **Trigram**: Zhen ☳ (Thunder) | **JADC2**: Electronic Warfare (Disruptor) | **HIVE**: EVOLVE (E)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **OODA Chaos**: {2}: Create a 1/1 HFO Agent token.
- **Cull the Weak**: Sacrifice an HFO: Target opponent loses life equal to the number of HFO agents you control. (Error Culling).

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given an adversarial cycle of repetitive error loops
When the red regnant culls sub-optimal agents for mutation fuel
Then disrupt the failing terminal loops to enable evolution
```

- **HardGate Sentry**: Whenever an HFO is promoted to Gold layer, return Pyre Praetorian from graveyard to battlefield.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given a Bronze artifact artifact with unverified provenance
When the pyre praetorian audits cryptographic signatures
Then promote the artifact to Gold or sacrifice it for rebirth
```

### [P6] KRAKEN KEEPER (ASSIMILATE)
> **Trigram**: Dui ☱ (Lake) | **JADC2**: Logistics / Sustain (Assimilator) | **HIVE**: INTERLOCK (I)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Datalake Storage**: Whenever an HFO card is put into exile from anywhere, put a Knowledge counter on Kraken Keeper.
- **Assimilation**: {T}, Remove 8 Knowledge counters: You may cast a card from exile without paying its mana cost.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given new telemetry receipts and verified swarm outcomes
When the kraken keeper exiles structured data into the lake
Then persist immutable stigmergy records in the DuckDB archive
```

> **Trigram**: Qian ☰ (Heaven) | **JADC2**: BMC2 / Command (Navigator) | **HIVE**: HUNT (H)

#### 🎴 MAGIC ABILITIES (MECHANICS)
- **Sovereign Command**: HFO cards you own that aren't on the battlefield have Flash.
- **Octal Synchronization**: You win the game if you control 8 HFO Commanders and have 87.5% (7/8) of your library in exile.

#### 💻 CODE GHERKIN (DECLARATIVE)
```gherkin
Given a mission objective and 512 distributed swarm agents
When the spider sovereign executes BMC2 orchestration logic
Then achieve 87.5% quorum and navigate the swarm to completion
```
