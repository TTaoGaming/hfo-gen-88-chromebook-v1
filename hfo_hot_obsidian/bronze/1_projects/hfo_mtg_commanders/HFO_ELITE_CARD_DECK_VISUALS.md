## 📊 THE APEX HEURISTIC

- **Singleton**: Only one of each Legendary Commander is permitted in the 64-card deck.
- **Scaling**: Benefits plateau at **512 (8^3)** agents, representing the full saturation of the 8-port manifold.
- **Medallion Flow**: A P5 "Death" (Demotion to Bronze) is required for some cards to trigger their "Rebirth" (Promotion to Silver/Gold) abilities.
