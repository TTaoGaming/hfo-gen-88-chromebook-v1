## 🏗️ THE HFO CORE: [THE HIVE/8 AGENT]

**Hive/8 Agent**
*Artifact Creature Token — HFO Agent Tile*
Stats: 1/1
*(HFO agents are disaggregated tiles. Control 8 to achieve Octal Synchronization $8^1$.)*

**HFO Type Definition**:
*Swarm Intelligence. Creatures you control with the HFO type share all non-activated abilities with other HFO permanents you control. (The "Sliver" effect, integrated via the Galois Lattice).*

**The HFO Goldilocks Zone**:
- **Pareto Optimal**: 88% (matches 7/8 cognitive shards / 87.5%).
- **Target Zone**: 80% - 99% mutation/protection score.
- **Red Truth**: Verifiable failure is superior to a deceptive success (Red Truth > Green Lie).
