# Timestamp: 2026-01-25
# Provenance: fork/evolve from Gen7 v5 spec.
# Posture: Draft spec (future work).

  theme: "v6 = knuckle-TripPlane orientation → key mapping"
  theme_one_liner: "Orientation-bucketed mappings (yaw/roll/axis) layered on v5 zones without breaking v4 invariants."
  intent:
    - "Use knuckle tripplane orientation (axis + normal) as an input to key mapping."
    - "Support orientation-conditioned mappings (e.g., rotate mapping based on hand yaw/roll)."

    note: "Spec-only: Gen7 v2+ HTML entrypoints are intentionally absent until promoted."

orientation_mapping:
  inputs:
    - "TripPlane axisUiNorm (2D) or axisWorld (3D)"
    - "TripPlane normal (optional)"
    - "hand side (Left/Right)"
  policies:
    - "Fail-closed unless explicitly enabled by flag."
    - "Orientation is bucketed into a small number of discrete states (e.g., 4 quadrants) for deterministic mapping."

validation:
  posture: "TDD-first"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Orientation buckets are stable under small noise (hysteresis)."
    - "Mapping remains deterministic per handKey and reversible for replay."
    - "Does not weaken v4 identity stability or v5 zone mapping invariants."
