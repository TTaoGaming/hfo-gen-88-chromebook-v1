  intent: >-
    Establish a canonical Alpha project root and versioned spec so Alpha can evolve
    with the same generation/version discipline as Omega.

non_negotiables:
  - Fail-closed boundaries: cross-port data must flow through explicit contracts.
  - Immutable provenance: every action emits append-only receipts (MCP memory + blackboard).
  - Pointers are the stable entry surface; no hidden coupling.

bootstrap_next_step:
  single_best_next_step: >-
    Make a deterministic capsule+receipt preflight mandatory for every agent run:
    (1) resolve objective pointer, (2) compile role-scoped capsule (P7 or P1),
    (3) validate contracts, (4) write receipt.
  why: >-
    You already have stores (DuckDB/FTS/vectors/graphs); brittleness comes from missing
    compilation+governance. Mandatory capsules+receipts prevent drift across roles and horizons.

phase_plan:
  phase_0_invariants:
    - Define Objective Pointer (single source of truth) and require it at start of every run.
    - Define Receipt schema and require it at end of every run.
  phase_1_alpha_generation_bootstrap:
    - Use this Alpha Gen1 spec as canonical.
    - Add pointers to Alpha Gen1 project root + spec.
  phase_2_capsule_compiler:
    - Implement a capsule compiler over existing JSONL + DuckDB.
    - Emit P7 strategic capsule and P1 tactical capsule deterministically.
  phase_3_drift_firewall:
    - Add invariant checks: stale pointers, missing receipts, contract failures, contradictions.
  phase_4_memory_delegation:
    - Introduce a memory curator daemon/agent that maintains summaries/graphs off the hot path.
