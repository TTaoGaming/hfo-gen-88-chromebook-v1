purpose: >-
  Make phases explicit and lock in the workflow so agents stop drifting:
  Spec (YAML) -> Contract (Zod) -> RED tests (TDD/BDD/CDD) -> Implementation -> Receipts.

non_negotiables:
  - Always write the spec YAML first.
  - Always write or update contracts next.
  - Always write RED tests next (TDD + BDD + CDD).
  - Only then implement.
  - Every run must emit a receipt with sources.

phase0_deliverables:
  contracts:
    - contracts/hfo_phase_receipt.zod.ts
  tests:
    - contracts/__tests__/hfo_phase_receipt.test.ts
  pointers:
    - hfo_pointers.json targets.hfo_phase0_infra_spec_v0_1

bdd_promises (human-readable behavior):
  - Given an agent run starts, when it begins, then it MUST resolve the objective pointer.
  - Given an agent completes a run, when it ends, then it MUST append a phase receipt with sources.

cdd_promises (contract-driven behavior):
  - All phase receipts MUST validate against PhaseReceiptSchema.

objective_pointer_policy:
  ssot: >-
    A single objective pointer MUST exist that states "what matters now" for Alpha+Omega.
  note: >-
    This spec defines the policy, but does not yet implement the pointer storage.
