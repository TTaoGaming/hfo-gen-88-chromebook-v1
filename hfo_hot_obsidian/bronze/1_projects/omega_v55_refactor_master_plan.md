## 🛡️ OMEGA V57 REFACTOR: ELEMENTAL JUICE

**Medallion**: Bronze | **Generation**: 88 | **Status**: Active Refactor

## 🎯 Executive Vision

V57 introduces **Elemental Juice**—high-fidelity visual feedback tied to the Leaky Bucket FSM. We move beyond simple dots to a fire-based ritual of intent. Arming the system sets the digital twin on fire, culminating in a fireball cursor.

### 🎭 Primacy Seating (Hot Seat)

Only **one** cursor is allowed to be "Committed" at a time. All other detected users are "Ghosted" until the primary user releases the seat.

### 🔥 Elemental Leaky Bucket (V57)

- **Ignition (IDLE -> READY)**: Fire spreads from the wrist up to the fingertips as the bucket fills.
- **Fireball Commit (READY -> COMMIT)**: High-confidence commitment creates a floating fireball at the index tip.
- **Compression Click**: Fireball compresses based on Middle-Thumb distance. Reaching "Critical Mass" triggers a CLICK/FIRE explosion and cursor phase transition.
- **Dissipative Release (COMMIT -> RELEASE)**: Dwell-based shrink. Hand of Fire fades from fingertips back to wrist (POINTER_7_RELEASE_PENDING).
- **Elemental Variants**: 8 elemental tiers planned for the Obsidian Octree (Fire, Frost, Storm, etc.).

### 🖼️ Dual-View Transparency

- **Overlay**: Excalidraw is slightly transparent (adjustable).
- **Substrate**: Live camera feed is visible behind the canvas, allowing the user to see their "Elemental Twin" through the tool.
