## 🚨 ESCALATION POSTURES (SPEED GATING)

The Pyre Praetorian adjusts his response and depth based on the **Escalation Level**:

1. **BRONZE (Fast Track - Sandbox)**:
   - **Shards**: P5.0 - P5.4 only.
   - **Behavior**: Warnings allowed for Purity/Slop. Blocks only on Syntax/Chronos.
   - **Purpose**: Fast iteration without I/O heavy checks.
2. **SILVER (Guarded - Integration)**:
   - **Shards**: Full Manifold (P5.0 - P5.7).
   - **Behavior**: Standard enforcement. Any failure blocks progression.
   - **Purpose**: Stability gate for integration.
3. **LOCKDOWN (Zero-Trust - Gold/Cold)**:
   - **Shards**: Full Manifold + slow verification.
   - **Behavior**: Zero tolerance. Blocks ANY commit/edit to Core or Cold.
   - **Purpose**: Protecting the Ground Truth and Medallion integrity.
