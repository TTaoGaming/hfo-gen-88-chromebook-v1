# OMEGA GEN 4 V29.0 SPECIFICATION
# Focus: Absolute UPE Authority, Zero-CDN Parity, Operator Loop Lock

mission_objectives:
  - id: P0_LOCAL_ASSETS
    status: HARD_REQUIREMENT
    description: "Phase 4 - Zero-CDN. Use local FilesetResolver base path. Load WASM and .task models from lib/mediapipe/."
    source: omega_gen4_v25_spec

  - id: P1_UPE_AUTHORITY
    status: CRITICAL
    description: "Make UPE truly authoritative. No other code should compute clientX/clientY mappings or zoom margins outside UPE to eliminate edge-reach distortion."

  - id: P7_OPERATOR_LOCK
    status: ESSENTIAL
    description: "Implement Essentials/Developer gate. Single readiness gauge as the only 'arming truth' in the UI to ensure one successful click in 30s without noise."
    source: omega_gen4_v25_spec

technical_debt:
  - id: EDGE_DISTORTION
    type: COORDINATE_DRIFT
    description: "Reported coordinate distortion at screen edges due to non-UPE calculations."

  - id: CDN_DEPENDENCY
    type: INFRASTRUCTURE_FRAGILITY
    description: "Relying on unpkg.com and jsdelivr causes latency and offline failure."

  - id: DEBUG_NOISE
    type: UX_FRICTION
    description: "UI clutter during arming sequence interferes with mission operations."

findings:
  - id: IFRAME_OFFSET_DRIFT
    description: "Manual iframeRect.left/top subtractions in dispatchToHydraHydrant caused parity drift at edges. Fixed by centralizing toClientX/Y in UPE."
  - id: ZOOM_OFFSET_CONSISTENCY
    description: "Inconsistent use of offsetX/offsetY variables across drawing vs interaction layers. UPE now enforces these globally."
