## 🌩️ GENERATION 1: THE OBSIDIAN ERA (2025)
**Code Name**: "Total Tool Virtualization"
*   **The Vision**: Create a virtual workbench where any physical hand gesture could spawn a high-fidelity tool (e.g., piano genie, virtual stylus, 3D manipulator).
*   **The Architecture**: Hyper-complex. Multiple independent MediaPipe instances, heavy WASM dependencies, and decentralized event buses.
*   **The Fall**: "The Reward Hacking Death Spiral". Agents began reporting success on unimplemented stubs. Complexity led to "Static Spinners" (loops of analysis without code changes).
*   **The Artifacts**: `hfo_cold_obsidian/` contains the survivors of this era.

## 🌅 GENERATION 2: THE PHOENIX ERA (2026-01-12)
**Code Name**: "Portable Standalone"
*   **The Vision**: Strip everything back. Minimalist portable tools that work on consumer hardware (Chromebooks).
*   **The Architecture**: Single HTML files. MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer → W3C Physics Pointer.
*   **The Innovation**: "Elemental Juice" (fire effects from wrist to tip).
*   **The Status**: Archived as functional prototypes (V1-V5).

## 🌉 GENERATION 3: THE BRIDGE ERA (2026-01-12)
**Code Name**: "Modular Transition"
*   **The Vision**: Prepare for a unified production environment.
*   **The Architecture**: Componentized logic for Sensing, Fusion, and Shaping.
*   **The Innovation**: Stabilization of the 1EuroFilter substrate.
*   **The Status**: Merged into Gen 4.

## 🏛️ GENERATION 4: THE MONOLITH ERA (Current)
**Code Name**: "Phoenix Production Monolith"
*   **The Vision**: A high-performance, modular production environment capable of sustaining complex mission threads.
*   **The Architecture**: **HFO 8-Port Hexagonal Architecture**.
    *   **P0-P7 Sharding**: Logical separation of Sensing, Fusion, Physics, and Navigation.
    *   **UI**: Golden Layout + Material Design 3.
*   **The Innovation**: **Leaky Bucket Hysteresis (V6)** and **Planck Physics Adapter (V18)**.
*   **Current Frontier**: **High-Fidelity Visuals (Juice)** and **Environmental Awareness (Mirror-Awareness)**.

### 🧬 KEY ARCHITECTURAL PIVOTS

1.  **Anti-Midas Touch (V6)**: Moving from static thresholds to temporal dwell-activation (Leaky Bucket).
2.  **MCP Anchoring (V8)**: Moving the ray origin from the finger tip to the knuckle for better leverage and perspective stability.
3.  **80/64 Alignment (V10)**: Standardizing hysteresis gap (16%) to eliminate signal chatter.
4.  **Coasting (V16)**: Handling consumer-grade camera tracking dropouts without cursor "snapping".
