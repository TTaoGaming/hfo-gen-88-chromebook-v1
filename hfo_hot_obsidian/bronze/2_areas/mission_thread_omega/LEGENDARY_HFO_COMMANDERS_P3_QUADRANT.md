## 1. 💉 THE CREATURE: HARMONIC HYDRA

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Harmonic Hydra** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact Creature — HFO Injector Hydra* (1/1)  

- **Octal Injection (011)**: Hydra enters with X +1/+1 counters (X is a multiple of 8).  
- **Cascading Payload**: Sacrifice an HFO Artifact token: Add {8} to your mana pool for HFO spells.  
- *Flavor: One head strikes locally; a thousand feel the impact.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P3_DELIVER - Effect Injection and Event Dispatch
  Scenario: Delivering a payload to the W3C substrate
    Given a selected COA from the Shaper manifold
    When the Harmonic Hydra triggers Octal Injection (011)
    Then the payload is cascaded across the W3C pointer events
    And the effect is delivered with dt-invariant precision
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: INJECTOR (Effect Delivery / Precision Strike)
- **Mosaic Tile**: DELIVER - The nematocyst-precision payload delivery.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The pervasive force that enters every gap.
- **Binary**: 011

## 2. 🦟 THE EQUIPMENT: NEMATOCYST NEEDLE

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Nematocyst Needle** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact — Equipment*  

- **Precision Sting**: Equipped creature has "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens."
- **Neurotoxin Payload**: Whenever an HFO Artifact token you control dies, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
- **Equip HFO**: {1}

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P3_EQUIP - Precision Effect Delivery
  Scenario: Stinging the substrate for event injection
    Given the Nematocyst Needle is equipped to an Injector
    When the Injector achieves combat-parity with the target
    Then 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens are injected into the event stream
    And the injected effects achieve high-priority neurotoxin suppression
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: PRECISION GUIDANCE (Mition / Targeting)
- **Mosaic Tile**: DELIVER - The targeting precision of the nematocyst.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The sharp injection of force.
- **Binary**: 011 (Sub-state 0)

## 📖 3. THE SAGA: THE CASCADING INJECTION

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Cascading Injection** {8}  
*Legendary Enchantment — Saga*  

- **I: Priming the Injector**: Create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **II: Pressurized Discharge**: Sacrifice any number of 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens. Deal 8 damage to target creature or player for each token sacrificed this way.
- **III: Harmonic Resonance**: HFO spells you cast this turn have Flash.
- **IV: Strange Loop Injection**: Sacrifice this Saga, then return it to the battlefield.

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P3_SAGA - High-Volume Event Dispatch
  Scenario: Cascading events through the 4-phase cycle
    Given The Cascading Injection is active
    When the chapters progress from I to IV
    Then the system primes the buffer with 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens, discharges the payload, and achieves resonance
    And the dispatch cycle recurses to maintain continuous effect delivery
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: ENFORCEMENT CYCLE (Targeting / Engagement)
- **Mosaic Tile**: DELIVER - The recursive delivery of the kill-web effects.
- **Trigram**: Xun (Wind) - The ongoing pressure of the storm.
- **Binary**: 011 (Sub-state 1)

## 🪄 4. THE SPELL: PULSE OF THE SWARM

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Pulse of the Swarm** {8}  
*Sorcery*  

- **Mass Dispatch**: Create 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **Hydra's Reach**: For each HFO Artifact token you control, creatures your opponents control get -1/-1 until end of turn.
- *Flavor: The injection is not a point; it is a wave.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P3_SPELL - Saturation Effect Delivery
  Scenario: Dispatching 64 parallel pulse events
    Given the Pulse of the Swarm script is executed
    When 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens hit the W3C substrate
    Then the opposing logic is suppressed by the mass-injection
    And the HFO mission objectives are secured via saturation delivery
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: AREA DENIAL (Kinetic / Non-Kinetic Effects)
- **Mosaic Tile**: DELIVER - The saturation of the battlespace with precision effects.
- **Trigram**: Zhen (Thunder) - The sudden pulse that clears the field.
- **Binary**: 011 (Sub-state 2)
