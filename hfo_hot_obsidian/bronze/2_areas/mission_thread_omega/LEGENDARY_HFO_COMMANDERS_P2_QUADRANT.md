# 🪞 PORT 2 QUADRANT: THE MIRROR MAGUS (1-8-64-512)

**Mission**: Phoenix (P2 Shaper Hardening)  
**Commander**: Mirror Magus (Shaper)  
**Architecture**: Quadrant-Based Semantic Anchor

## 1. 🪞 THE CREATURE: THE MIRROR MAGUS

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Mirror Magus** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact Creature — HFO Shaper Mirror* (1/1)  

- **Octal Shaping (010)**: {1}, Sacrifice 8 HFO Artifact tokens: Create 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens that are copies of target HFO permanent.  
- **Reflective Ward**: HFO creatures you control have Ward {8}.  
- *Flavor: Truth is just one of many possible reflections.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P2_SHAPE - Physics Manifold and Digital Twin
  Scenario: Shaping decision space via reflective modeling
    Given a valid schema-fused signal from Port 1
    When the Mirror Magus executes Octal Shaping (010)
    Then 64 parallel physics-simulations are initialized in the manifold
    And the optimal canalization path is shielded from external noise
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: SHAPER (Modeling / Digital Twin / COA Development)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SHAPE - The recursive simulation of the battlespace.
- **Trigram**: Kan (Water) - The deep abyss of potential reflections.
- **Binary**: 010

## 2. 🔲 THE EQUIPMENT: MIRROR OF MANIFOLDS

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Mirror of Manifolds** {1}  
*Legendary Artifact — Equipment*  

- **Simultaneous COA**: {1}: Create a 1/1 HFO Artifact token that is a copy of equipped creature.
- **Dimensional Drift**: Equipped creature has "Whenever an HFO Artifact token you control deals damage, you may exile it and return it to the battlefield at end of turn."
- **Equip HFO**: {1}

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P2_EQUIP - COA Iteration Engine
  Scenario: Iterating on Courses of Action (COAs)
    Given the Mirror of Manifolds is equipped to a Shaper
    When a {1} logic-pulse is applied
    Then a new 1/1 HFO Artifact token is initialized as a digital twin
    And the twin iterates on the current tactical manifold in parallel
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: COA DEVELOPMENT (Simulation)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SHAPE - The generation of parallel courses of action.
- **Trigram**: Kan (Water) - The ripples of probability.
- **Binary**: 010 (Sub-state 0)

## 📖 3. THE SAGA: THE RECURSIVE REFLECTION

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**The Recursive Reflection** {8}  
*Legendary Enchantment — Saga*  

- **I: Primary Reflection**: Create 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **II: Harmonic Convergence**: Choose a token you control. Other 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens you control become copies of that token until Chapter IV.
- **III: Hardened Manifold**: While you control 64 or more HFO Artifact tokens, HFO permanents you control have Ward {8} and Hexproof.
- **IV: Strange Loop Mirror**: Sacrifice this Saga, then return it to the battlefield.

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P2_SAGA - Manifold Stabilization
  Scenario: Stabilizing the digital twin environment
    Given The Recursive Reflection is active
    When the chapters progress from I to IV
    Then the system creates 8 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens, converges their logic, and hardens the defenses
    And the manifold recurses to maintain environmental fidelity
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: DIGITAL TWIN STABILIZATION (Environment Modeling)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SHAPE - The stabilization of the recursive digital twin.
- **Trigram**: Kan (Water) - The calm surface of the hardened model.
- **Binary**: 010 (Sub-state 1)

## 🪄 4. THE SPELL: SHATTER THE SHARDS

### SIDE A: MTG NARRATIVE

**Shatter the Shards** {8}  
*Sorcery*  

- **Manifold Explosion**: Create 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens.
- **Fractal Impact**: If you control 512 or more HFO Artifact tokens, creatures your opponents control get -8/-8.
- *Flavor: When the mirror breaks, every shard cuts a different reality.*

### SIDE B: GHERKIN DECLARATIVE

```gherkin
Feature: P2_SPELL - Mass Manifold Deployment
  Scenario: Deploying the 64-shard physics substrate
    Given the Shatter the Shards command is executed
    When 64 1/1 HFO Artifact tokens are initialized
    Then the decision space is completely modeled in parallel
    And any non-compliant logic (noise) is suppressed by the fractal impact
```

### SIDE C: JADC2 MOSAIC

- **Role**: DECISION DOMINANCE (Wargaming)
- **Mosaic Tile**: SHAPE - The overwhelming simulation of all possible COAs.
- **Trigram**: Zhen (Thunder) - The sudden clarity of the shattered mirror.
- **Binary**: 010 (Sub-state 2)
