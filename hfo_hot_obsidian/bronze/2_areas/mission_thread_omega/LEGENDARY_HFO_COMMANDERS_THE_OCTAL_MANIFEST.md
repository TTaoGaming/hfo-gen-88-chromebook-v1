## 🏗️ THE HFO CORE CONTRACT

All Commanders and sub-entities (Equipment, Sagas, Spells) operate under the **HFO** type.

- **Apex Hive (The Obsidian Spider)**: HFO is Tyranid-adjacent in function but Obsidian-governed in spirit. Every node operates under the direct command of the **Obsidian Spider** hivemind. This is not a "shared trait" like the Slivers; it is a **Command-and-Control** hierarchy (BMC2).
- **Apex Hive (Capability Inheritance)**: Unlike traditional slivers which share single traits, HFO permanents share total functional state. This is the difference between a "sliver" (a fragment) and the "HFO" (the whole).
- **Token Unification**: All references to tokens are strictly **1/1 HFO Artifact** tokens with no inherent abilities (all power is derived from the Commanders/Ports).
- **Octal Constraints**: All numbers are powers of 8 (1, 8, 64, 512).
