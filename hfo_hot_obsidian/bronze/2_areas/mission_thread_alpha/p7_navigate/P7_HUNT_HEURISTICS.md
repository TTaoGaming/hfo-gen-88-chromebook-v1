# 🧭 Port 7 (Navigate): Meta-Hive Hunt Heuristics

**Commander**: Spider Sovereign
**Phase**: Hunt (H) / Meta-Loop Integration
**Mission Context**: HFO Gen 88 Phoenix Resurrection

---

## 🧠 Hyper-Heuristic Anchors
The following heuristics have been harvested from one year of operational hindsight (Generation 88) and are now locked as steering logic for the Port 7 Navigator.

### 1. JADC2 Mosaic Warfare Tiles
Synchronizing disaggregated effects across 8 Commanders. Each port is a "tile" in the mosaic, capable of autonomous action while remaining globally coherent via the blackboard.

### 2. MTG Sliver Collective Synergy
Every tool, agent, and line of code added to the swarm increases the capabilities of the total collective. Capabilities (slivers) flow across the 8-port manifold.

### 3. The Cognitive Exoskeleton (Symbiote)
**Thread Alpha Target**: The platform is not a tool, but a symbiotic layer. Like the "Venom/King in Black" narrative, the HFO system bonds with the operator's intent to create a unified cognitive command node.

### 4. Construct Manifestation (The Omega Effect)
**Thread Omega Target**: The synthesis of virtual ordnance. A fusion of "Iron Man" (Engineering), "Dr. Strange" (Form/Geometry), and "Green Lantern" (Intent-to-Manifestation).

## 🎯 Active Hunt Objectives (P0 + P7)
- [ ] Map the MediaPipe landmark stream (P0) to the Navigator's coordinate manifold (P7).
- [ ] Identify valid "Substrate Tiles" (Excalidraw, Piano Genie) for initial thread Omega manifestation.
- [ ] Establish the first Zod-hardened contract for hand-landmark-to-intent synthesis.
