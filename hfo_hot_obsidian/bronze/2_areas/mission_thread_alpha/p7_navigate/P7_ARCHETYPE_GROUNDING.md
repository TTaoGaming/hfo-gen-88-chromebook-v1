# 🧬 P7: Sliver & Card Archetype Grounding

**Commander**: Spider Sovereign (Port 7)
**Framework**: MTG Archetypes x JADC2 Mosaic Warfare
**Mission Thread**: Alpha (Bootstrapping)

## 1. The Sliver Archetype (Synergy & Disaggregation)

The "Sliver" is not just a card; it is the **Fundamental Unit of Shared Capability**.

- **HFO Definition**: An autonomous agent or tool that, when introduced to the hive, grants its unique property to every other component.
- **JADC2 Correlation**: **Disaggregated Functional Tiles**. Every sensor (P0) and every effector (P3) is a tile that shares state across the "Data Fabric" (P1).
- **Archetype Property**: **Omni-Directional Capability Flow**. If P5 (DEFEND) is "Indestructible," then the logic for indestructibility applies to the P6 (STORE) telemetry and P0 (SENSE) streams.

## 2. The Card Archetype (Role-Based Grounding)

We map the behavior of standard Magic: The Gathering card archetypes to JADC2 Mosaic Warfare roles.

| MTG Archetype | HFO/Port | JADC2 Role | Operational Behavior |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **The Searcher** | P7 | **BMC2 / Orchestrator** | Navigates the "Library" of code/tools. Fetches on-demand capability. (Sliver Overlord) |
| **The Mana Mirror** | P1 | **Data Fabric/Bridge** | Converts raw environmental data into actionable energy/types. (Gemhide/Mirror Entity) |
| **The Token Generator** | P4 | **Chaos/Entropy Node** | Rapidly manifests disaggregated decoys or feedback loops to overwhelm AD. (Sliver Queen) |
| **The Cascade** | P3 | **Kill-Web Disseminator** | Recursive effect injection. One "trigger" launches a chain of functional effects. (The First Sliver) |
| **The Anthem/Legion** | P7 | **Force Multiplier** | Passive scaling based on the density of the swarm. Exponential power through presence. (Sliver Legion) |

## 3. Archetypal Operational Loop (HIVE)

The HIVE workflow is an archetypal expression of MTG "Phase" logic.

1. **HUNT (Untap/Upkeep/Draw)**: Sensing current resources and identifying the next threat/tool. (P0 SENSE)
2. **INTERLOCK (Main Phase 1)**: Mapping functional synergy (The Bridge). (P1 FUSE)
3. **VALIDATE (Combat/Main Phase 2)**: Testing the effects in physics/simulation. (P2 SHAPE)
4. **EVOLVE (End Step)**: Persisting the learned state into the history. (P6 STORE)

## 4. JADC2 Mosaic Warfare Alignment

- **Complexity through Simplicity**: Like Sliver abilities, HFO uses small, simple, robust protocols (Zod 6.0) to build a complex, resilient whole.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Loss of a single "Card" (Port) does not break the "Deck" (System). The P7 Navigator re-routes based on the remaining "Hand" (Current State).
