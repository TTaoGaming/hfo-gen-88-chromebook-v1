# 🧠 P7: The Octet of Thinking Tools (Tactical Thinking Manifold)

**Commander**: Spider Sovereign (Port 7)
**Goal**: Align 8 distinct cognitive tools with the 8-Port Architecture to enforce rigorous "Hunt" phase analysis.
**Mechanism**: Every tool execution must generate a **Tamper-Evident Receipt** in the blackboard.

## The Thinking Octet Mapping

| Tool ID | Thinking Mode | Port Alignment | JADC2/Narrative Context |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **T0** | **Sense Discovery** | P0 (Observe) | Raw data ingestion and signal/noise calibration. |
| **T1** | **Sequential Reasoning** | P1 (Bridge) | Logical step-through and causal bridging (1 -> 2 -> 3). |
| **T2** | **Galois Lattice Mapping** | P2 (Shape) | Geometric/Structural alignment of problem across the 8x8 matrix. |
| **T3** | **Event Injection/FSM** | P3 (Inject) | Simulating W3C Pointer events or kinetic ordnance effects. |
| **T4** | **Scream Audit (Entropy)** | P4 (Disrupt) | Identifying chaos, hallucinations, and "Theater" (Electronic Warfare). |
| **T5** | **Governance/Shielding** | P5 (Defend) | Integrity checks, Medallion flow compliance, and resurrection needs. |
| **T6** | **Historical Synthesis** | P6 (Store) | Consulting the blackboard logs and DuckDB telemetry (Librarian). |
| **T7** | **Mission Orchestration** | P7 (Navigate) | Hyper-heuristic steering and "King in Black" narrative anchoring. |

## Tamper-Evident Receipt Protocol

Every thinking tool call must append a `thought_receipt` to the blackboard following this Zod-ready schema:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601",
  "phase": "H",
  "tool": "T[0-7]",
  "thought_hash": "SHA256(content)",
  "port_lock": "P[0-7]",
  "tokens_used": "number",
  "token_cap": "number",
  "payload": {
    "summary": "Short description",
    "medallion": "Bronze|Silver|Gold"
  }
}
```

## 💰 Token Budget Management (Fractal Sharding)

To prevent context window saturation, the Navigator enforces a **Fractal Shard Budget**. Port 7 (Navigate) is allocated a fixed percentage of the global context, which is then divided equally among the octet.

**P7 Master Shard**: 8,192 Tokens (Tunable global allocation for Navigator Abstraction)
**Sub-Shard (Budget/8)**: 1,024 Tokens per Thinking Tool

| Tool ID | Thinking Mode | Port Alignment | Shard Cap (Tokens) |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **T0** | Sense Discovery | P0 (Observe) | 1,024 |
| **T1** | Sequential Reasoning | P1 (Bridge) | 1,024 |
| **T2** | Galois Lattice | P2 (Shape) | 1,024 |
| **T3** | Event Injection | P3 (Inject) | 1,024 |
| **T4** | Scream Audit | P4 (Disrupt) | 1,024 |
| **T5** | Governance/Shield | P5 (Defend) | 1,024 |
| **T6** | Hist. Synthesis | P6 (Store) | 1,024 |
| **T7** | Mission Orchestrat.| P7 (Navigate)| 1,024 |

## Execution Logic (The Hunt Heuristic)

1. **Initialize Hunt**: Port 7 activates the Octet.
2. **Parallel Thinking**: Tools T0-T6 can fire in parallel to assess the situation.
3. **Consolidation**: Tool T7 (Orchestrate) synthesizes the octet into a final plan.
4. **Receipt Freeze**: All receipts are committed before the "I" (Interlock) phase begins.
