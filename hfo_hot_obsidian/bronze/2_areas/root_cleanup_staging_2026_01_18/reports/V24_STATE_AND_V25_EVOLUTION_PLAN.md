## 🎖️ V24: THE PHOENIX POC (Current State)

The `omega_gen4_v24_clone_v23_1_POC_WORKING.html` represents the first stable "Hybrid Substrate" where **Babylon.js** (Visuals) and **MediaPipe** (Sensing) are successfully bridged via the **Port 1 Data Fabric**.

### ✅ Successes (The "Green Truth")

- **Hydra-Pulse-Adapter (P3)**: Resolved the Excalidraw interaction failure. By firing a "Pulse Click" (10ms settle buffer) during the `COMMIT` transition, the tool becomes responsive to virtual prompts.
- **Direct Projection (P2)**: Implementation of `useDirectProjection` (V20.6) has successfully suppressed the longitudinal "jitter" induced by the Mass-Spring loop during high-velocity movements.
- **Visual Juice (P4)**: The "Phoenix Core" fire effect is successfully unprojected from 2D screen space to a 3D Babylon.js plane, providing a high-fidelity visual anchor.
- **Expert UI (P7)**: Golden Layout panels are fully functional, providing real-time telemetry for Z-Normal, Bucket Charge, and FSM states.

### ⚠️ Bugs & Critical Issues (The "Red Truth")

1. **Provenance Dissonance**: Internal headers/title still reference V23.1. This violates Medallion strictness and complicates audit logs.
2. **Asset Fragility**: The system currently relies on 6+ external CDNs. For an "Obsidian" project, this is a P5 breach of self-sufficiency.
3. **Water (DUI) Element Stub**: While the "Fire" element is hardened, the "Water" element distortion requested in previous cycles is still in a "Bronze-Incubation" state (Canvas-only, lacking Babylon integration).
4. **Anatomical Hardening**: Rod length calculation remains tied to screen-space hacks rather than absolute camera-intrinsic world coordinates ($W = f \cdot D / w$).
5. **FSM Coast Logic**: The `COAST` state is currently a "leaky" timeout rather than a true inertial physics state.

## 🚀 ROADMAP: THE PATH TO V25 SILVER

We will NOT attempt a direct V25 Silver promotion immediately. Instead, we follow the **HIVE Evolution** path through **V24.1**.

### 🛠️ Phase 1: V24.1 Stabilization (Hot Bronze)

- **Asset Localization**: Stage `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`, `babylon.js`, and `golden-layout` in `/assets`.
- **Water Element Hardening**: Port the Water beam distortion to the `BabylonJuiceSubstrate`.
- **Anatomical Physics**: Implement `rodExtensionMultiplier` based on palm-width (Landmarks 5-17) normalization.
- **Header Clean-up**: Synchronize all internal metadata to **V24.1**.

### 💎 Phase 2: V25 Phoenix Rebirth (Silver)

- **Stryker Mutation Scoring**: Target the **88% Goldilocks Range**.
- **Port 5 HardGate**: Full automated audit against the `omega_gen4_v25_spec.yaml`.
- **Chronos Repair**: Final reconciliation of the global blackboard signature chain.
