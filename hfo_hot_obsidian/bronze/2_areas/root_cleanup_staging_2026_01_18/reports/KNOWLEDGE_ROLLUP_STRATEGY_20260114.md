## 📊 Workspace Telemetry

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start Date** | 2026-01-09 | Initial Phoenix Bootstrap. |
| **Duration** | 5 Days | High-velocity iteration cycle. |
| **Total Files** | 46,927 | Includes dependencies and deep versioning. |
| **Total Size** | 8.2 GB | Significant growth in Hot/Cold Obsidian layers. |
| **Hot Obsidian** | 2.2 GB | Active development, high entropy. |
| **Cold Obsidian** | 1.3 GB | Hardened records and historical shards. |
| **Evolution Count** | 109+ HTML Versions | Thread Omega Gen 4 iterations. |
| **Audit Logs** | 69+ `.jsonl` files | Immutable blackboards and forensic receipts. |

## 🕵️ Analysis of State

The workspace has reached high **Token Density** and **Spectral Complexity**.

- **Entropy High:** 109 versions of `omega_gen4` create massive cognitive load for the agent.
- **Red Truth Detection:** A P5 Breach in `omega_gen4_v23_1.html` indicates that the rapid iteration is beginning to outpace the validation logic.
- **BFT Consensus (0.8):** Shard 3 is flagging "Adversarial Theater," suggesting some logic paths are becoming redundant or hallucinatory.

## 🛠️ Rollup Options

### Option A: The Kraken Keeper (DuckDB FTS & Parquet)

**Focus:** Searchability and SQL Analytics.

- **Action:** Ingest all `.jsonl` blackboards and `reports/*.md` into a DuckDB database.
- **Mechanism:** Use FTS (Full-Text Search) for rapid cross-referencing of "Baton" signatures and "Red Truth" signals.
- **Benefit:** Transition from file-grep to structured telemetry. Identify exactly where resonance suppression or FSM logic diverged across 109 versions.

### Option B: Skeletonization (Recursive Distillation)

**Focus:** Medallion Purity.

- **Action:** Retain only the `_spec.yaml` files and the "Golden" version of each major milestone (e.g., v8, v20.6, v22).
- **Archive:** Move intermediate versions (v1-v7, v9-v19) to a compressed `.tar.gz` archive within `4_archive/` or a separate git branch.
- **Benefit:** Reduces file count from 46k to ~1k, drastically improving agent speed and reducing indexing friction.

### Option C: The Grimoire Consolidation

**Focus:** Narrative Knowledge Management.

- **Action:** Roll up all "Handoff Briefings" and "Forensic Reports" into the **GEN_88_HFO_GRIMOIRE.md**.
- **Process:** Extract the "Lessons Learned" and "Final Tuning Parameters" (1EuroFilter cutoffs, etc.) and delete the successful but redundant forensic receipts.
- **Benefit:** Creates a single SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for the current machine state.

## 🚀 Recommendation: The Tripartite Rollup

1. **Skeletonize** the `mission_thread_omega_gen_4/` directory immediately.
2. **Initialize Kraken-6 (DuckDB)** for the `.jsonl` logs to preserve "Red Truth" without keeping them in the active workspace root.
3. **Formalize Grimoire V1.1** with the distilled parameters for Port 1 (Fuse) and Port 2 (Shape).
