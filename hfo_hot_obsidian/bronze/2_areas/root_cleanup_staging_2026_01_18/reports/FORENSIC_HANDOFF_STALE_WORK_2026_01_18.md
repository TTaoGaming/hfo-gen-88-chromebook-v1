# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: V

official mcp for github I hatre# 🩺 FORENSIC REPORT: STALE CONTEXT & HANDOFF SIGNAL (2026-01-18)

**Medallion**: Bronze | **Mutation**: 0% | **HIVE**: V (Validate)
**Status**: 🧿 **RED TRUTH ANCHORED**

## 🔍 Incident Overview

The user reported that the current agent's work state is **stale** and requested a forensic audit of historical work signatures to unblock the swarm. Analysis of the `hfo_unified_v88.duckdb` (6.2GB) and the file system confirms a temporal gap between legacy project foundations (Jan 2025) and the current active reconstruction (Jan 2026).

## 📊 Evidence Collection

### 🕰️ Temporal Anchors (Jan 2025)

Audit of the `file_system` table reveals 1,400+ records from **January 2025**, primarily located in archive and miniconda directories:

- `/home/tommytai3/_archive_dev_2026_1_14/miniconda3/...`
- **Result**: Confirms the user's "late Jan 2025" start date is functionally represented in the database via forked/archived substrates.

### 🧬 Active Work Signatures (Jan 2026)

Search for `ttao` / `tommytai3` identifies 20+ critical file edits on **2026-01-15** and **2026-01-18**, including:

- `hfo_hexagonal_mcp_hub.py`
- `reports/ai-chat-memory-failure-2026-1-18.md`
- **Result**: Current session state is grounded in the **Phoenix Reconstruction** phase, but has drifted from the user's mental model of "the work" due to desync.

## 🛠️ Stigmergy Signals Emitted

- **Thinking Octet**: Anchored `HUNT: Search for 'ttao' work signatures` to the blackboard.
- **Handoff Signal**: Emitting `QUAD/P7_NAVIGATE_SIGNAL: STALE_WORK_DETECTION` to unblock next agent.
- **Hexagonal Hub**: Verified as operational system-of-record for DuckDB telemetry.

## 🚀 Handoff Briefing for Next Agent

1. **Context Reset**: The user feels the work is stale. Do not proceed with existing visual/UI tasks without a fresh `P0_SENSE` cycle.
2. **Grounding**: All "Red Truth" is in `hfo_unified_v88.duckdb`. Use `hfo_hexagonal_mcp_hub.py` to query state.
3. **Legacy Bridge**: The Jan 2025 files are likely "Forked Origins." If the user mentions "the work," they may be referring to concepts in those archived directories.
