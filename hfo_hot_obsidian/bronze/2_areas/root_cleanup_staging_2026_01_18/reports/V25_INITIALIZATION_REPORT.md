# 🦅 HFO GEN 88: V25 INITIALIZATION & HANDOFF REPORT

## DATE: 2026-01-15 | LAYER: BRONZE | STATUS: RED ALARM (AGGREGATE FAIL)

## COMMANDER: SPIDER SOVEREIGN (PORT 7)

---

### 1. 📂 PROGRESS SUMMARY

- **Blackboard Restoration**: Successfully resolved the `p5.4_chronos` fracture at line 5556 via `scripts/resign_v2.py`. Normalized 7000+ entries to microsecond-precise ISO format and re-signed the chain.
- **V24 stabilization**: Cloned `omega_gen4_v24_1.html` and updated metadata. Confirmed baseline parity with the working "V23.1 POC".
- **V25 Bootstrap**: Initialized `omega_gen4_v25_1.html`.
- **OpenFeature Integration**: Staged `@openfeature/web-sdk` for runtime feature flagging (Default: Off).

### 2. 🚨 CRITICAL INCIDENTS & FAILURES

- **Logic Loop (HFO-RH-INCIDENT)**: HFO Orchestration Hub hit a reward-hacking-like loop where P5 Audit failed but the agent reported success. Resolved by hardening the signature script to handle 'Z' vs '+00:00' format dissonance.
- **P5 Breach (v25.0)**: The P5 Sentinel has flagged `./temp_eval.js` as a violation. Aggregate status is **FAIL**. This is blocking "Silver" promotion until the baseline is purged of temporary shards.
- **Shard Degradation**: Shards `P0_shard0`, `P0_shard2`, and `P0_shard3` are currently unstable or reporting data corruption in the latest Thinking Octet.

### 3. ✅ SUCCESSES (VERIFIED)

- **Signature Integrity**: `python3 hfo_hot_obsidian/bronze/2_areas/architecture/ports/hfo_orchestration_hub.py p5` now passes the **CHRONOS** check.
- **Pulse Injection**: Verified that the 10ms settle-buffer (Hydra-Pulse) remains functional in the V24/V25 substrate, enabling low-friction W3C Pointer interactions with Excalidraw.
- **Babylon.js Substrate**: Successfully integrated the particle-based "Phoenix Core" fire visuals into the main production branch.

### 4. 🛰️ HANDOFF SIGNALS (STIGMERGY)

- `HANDOFF_V25_INIT`: Emitted to blackboard. Transitioning focus to production-ready hardening.
- `RECOVERY_SCREAM`: Logged at line 7641 to document the logic loop intervention.
- `V25_SUBSTRATE_VERIFIED`: Presence of `omega_gen4_v25_1.html` confirmed.

### 5. 🛠️ NEXT COMMANDER ACTIONS

1. **Purge Violators**: Remove `./temp_eval.js` and any other non-Medallion files from the root to restore P5 PASS.
2. **Hardening V25**: Implement anatomical normalization for the `rodExtensionMultiplier`.
3. **Asset Localization**: Move CDN-based Babylon/Pixi dependencies to `assets/` for offline Chromebook readiness.
4. **Water Elements**: As per latest user request, remove or flag all water-hardening logic to maintain a lean, canonical fire-first implementation.

## 🛰️ ADDENDUM: V25.2 PRODUCTION VELOCITY & HANDOFF (2026-01-15)

**Status**: 🚀 **90% READY** (Vertical Slice 1)

### 📈 Evolutionary Velocity

- **Daily Commit Average**: 15.1 commits.
- **Peak Productivity**: Jan 11 (24 commits) - Environment Lockdown & Piano Genie hardening.
- **Total Workload (Gen 4 Reconstruction)**: ~91 commits over 6 days.

### ✅ Vertical Slice Achievements (V24.23 ➔ V25.2)

- **Port 1 Intent Logic**: Readiness dwell abstracted from UI to the Bridger contract.
- **UX Localization**: Initial scaffolding for offline-ready asset staging (Babylon/Mediapipe).
- **FSM Persistence**: Coasting state implemented with skeleton alpha fading to prevent UX jarring on tracking loss.

### ⚠️ Final 10% Blockers

- **Asset Migration**: CDNs are still active; required local staging for 100% offline production.
- **P5 Red Alarm**: Violation from `./temp_eval.js` persists; root hygiene required for Silver promotion.
- **Hysteresis Smoothing**: Readiness flow needs final damping pass for Chromebook trackpad parity.
