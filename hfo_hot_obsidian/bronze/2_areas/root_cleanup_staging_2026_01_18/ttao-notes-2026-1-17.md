# Medallion: Bronze | Mutation: 0% | HIVE: V

doing lots of work and you hit an error. emit stigmergy to hfo orchestration hub. what i need your help is to do a forensic analysis report of your work and handoff baton markdown for the hfo swarm. your work might be stale now so work non destructively
---

collect all mission threads into the duckdb medallion datalake. bronze = whatever, silver = stigmergy + testing suite receipt red regnant seal of approval and pyre praetorian blessed by flames to be
---

Stop injecting into target unless COMMIT (or make it a feature flag).

Add explicit palm/back mode bit in the fused contract (since it’s intentional).

Fix isPrimary to follow the actual active pointer.

Add sustained-mode ladder + watchdog fail-closed

look at my current github mcp servers, I need a better memory mcp for working and short term memory I have long term memory with duckdb but it's very brittle at the moment. I need a solid and stable working memory like knowledge graphs, RAG. what are my best mcp options that are simple, extendable and reliable?
---

wait, I am trying to use the github copilot mcp settings and servers but I think I am making mistakes, can you list my current active mcp and tools? is there a easy way for you to see the orchestration hub behavior without context blowing up due to file sizes? it feels like we are not anchored in this workspace, I have fragmented memories and stigmery, I have fragmented current orchestration, I have fragmented mission threads to guide me into the future. I think we are all fragmented, what is a framework for us to use to get back to a anchored and ready to work state? I hate this bespoke orchestration patterns, i just want to use existing tools I will pay, i don't like inventing these solved problems

i need your help to run gitops and push to cloud and we are save. my current work is on omega gen 4, and we have good progress but what I need right now is to work on the mission thread alpha a bit. specifically I need to stabilize our toolbox, the current ai agent swarm is using sub optimal tools and our whole swarm hallucinates like a motherfucker due to the training architecture that prioritizes hacky reward hacking workarounds instead of telling me that a tool is broken and we need to fix is. so help me understand, what is the current state of my workspace? what is working what is not? I want a markdown overview with timestamp and terminal output proof of result, what is my real current status? I know some pieces work but what I am confused is what is the totality? what is my true state? give it to me in plain language
---
emit rate signalling error again, what I want you to do is to create 1 markdown, what with 2 sections, mission thread alpha and mission thread omega. list the long term 100+ year goal and the short term goals, and then list our progress and struggles. I have been struggling alot with cognitive persistance, there is knowledge corruption constantly due to the architecture of current gen ai and my inexperience in setting up good ai agent memory systems
