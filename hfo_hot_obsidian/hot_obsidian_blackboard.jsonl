Now, first I want to quickly explain the Langraph architecture that we're going to use for this agent just so you can understand what it is that we're about to [...] Reddit post, what we're going to do is we're going to start analyzing all of our results. So we're going to say analyze. And then the first thing that we're going to do is the Google results. So underscore Google results like that. Let's spell analyze correctly. Okay. Now let's copy this and go down here. Now, after retrieve Reddit post, we are also going to go and analyze the Bing results. Okay? And then we're going to go one more down here. After we retrieve the Reddit post, we're also going to analyze the Reddit results. All right? So, hopefully this is making sense. But again, if we go back to the architecture, we wait for the Reddit post, we retrieve them. Then after we retrieve them, we go and we analyze the Google results, the Bing results, and the Reddit results. That's what I've [...] base URL is equal to https/google.com/arch. And this needs to be ww.google.com/arch. We just add a new line here. We're going to say l if the engine is equal to bin or not bin, bing. Then the base URL is https www.bing.com/ bing.com/arch and then else we're going to raise an error and we're going to tell them hey this engine is not supported. So we're going to say raise value error and then unknown engine and then whatever engine they passed. Okay. Now we're going to say the URL is equal to https slash and this is going to be api.brightdata.com/ request. Okay, because this is where we're going to send the request and we're going to pass essentially the search URL that we want to search and get the data back from. Now, we're going to say our payload is equal to zone and the zone is going", "score": 0.3623603, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rakeshgohel01_9-modern-ai-agent-design-patterns-you-can-activity-7376959741526204417-tUE_", "title": "Learn 9 AI Agent Design Patterns for your projects - LinkedIn", "content": "3-Step Process Instead of one massive context dump, Skills work in smart layers: 1. Discovery: Claude first sees a tiny (~100 token) summary of every available Skill to know what's possible. 2. Activation: Only when a specific Skill is relevant to your task does it load the main instructions (`SKILL md`) into the context. 3. Execution: Deeper assets like code scripts or reference docs are only loaded on-demand as the agent executes the task. \ud83d\ude80 Why This is a Game Changer This architecture unlocks some powerful capabilities that go beyond simple customisation: \u2705 Composable: Claude can automatically identify and stack multiple Skills together to handle complex, multi-step tasks without you needing to chain them manually. \u2705 Portable: The same Skill can be used across Claude's apps, its API, [...] continuous integration (CI), and shadow traffic to test new prompts. Engineering focus will be deterministic wrappers around nondeterministic cores. 2) Vector DB\u2013driven personalization. Embeddings turn every docs, events, sessions into a semantic substrate. Instead of rules, products adapt with retrieval over user-level, team-level, and org-level contexts. The art will be in scoping: what is indexable, what is private, what is time decayed. The real-time signals like clicks, errors, completions should update the user\u2019s \u201cmemory\u201d within minutes, not sprints. It I s important to note that hybrid search will be the new default. 3) Guardrails for safe AI. If LLMs are the engine, guardrails are the brakes, seatbelts, and airbags. You need to start thinking layered controls like input sanitation [...] or React UI \u2192 Make it human-facing or keep it backend 4. Define your custom tools \u2192 Database searches, parsers, data filters \u2192 Keep functions modular for flexibility 5. Integrate tools into the agent\u2019s flow \u2192 Decide when and how tools are triggered \u2192 Map everything to Claude\u2019s context 6. Connect SmythOS \u2192 This enables: \u2714 Workflow automation \u2714 Smart data aggregation \u2714 Agent-level decision-making 7.

Parallel/chaining support makes them dynamic, but they rely on pro-code SDKs for advanced use.\n\nThis architecture emphasises composability and expertise injection, aligning with trends toward modular, skill-based systems over pure agent proliferation.\n\n### Overall Trends\n\nIn 2025, the field has largely moved beyond pure monoliths toward hybrids: workflows for orchestration + skills for specialisation. [...] #### Considerations\n\nAs tasks grew more complex, agents needed more tools.\n\nThis led to the tool explosion problem: too many tools overwhelm the LLM\u2019s context window, reduce reliability and make tool selection error-prone.\n\nResearch showed an optimal range of ~10\u201320 tools per agent before performance degrades significantly, prompting the question: when do you add more agents instead of more tools?\n\nThis architecture is simple and effective for prototyping but struggles with highly specialised or long-horizon tasks.\n\n### Agentic Workflows (Multi-Agent Orchestration)\n\nThis approach shifts from one generalist agent to orchestrated teams of lighter, specialised agents.\n\n#### Core Idea\n\nMultiple purpose-built agents act as nodes in a directed graph or workflow. [...] Leading surveys and industry reports highlight a clear shift away from pure monolithic agents toward modular, multi-agent, and hybrid designs.\n\nThe field recognises that no single architecture dominates all use cases\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead, the optimal choice depends on requirements like reliability, scalability, cost, and task complexity.\n\nMonolithic agents remain useful for rapid prototyping and simple tasks, but multi-agent workflows and skill libraries address their limitations in specialisation and long-horizon reliability.\n\nBy late 2025, hybrids are prevailing, orchestrated workflows with injected skills for domain expertise, powered by efficient models (like NVIDIA Nemotron series for multi-agent).", "score": 0.33180192, "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 1.42, "request_id": "545fa2be-4ec2-4a8a-a521-787ed5af7209"}, "web_brave": {"query": {"original": "Quad Search AI Agent architecture Context7 Greptile", "show_strict_warning": false, "is_navigational": true, "is_news_breaking": false, "spellcheck_off": true, "country": "us", "bad_results": false, "should_fallback": false, "postal_code": "", "city": "", "header_country": "", "more_results_available": true, "state": ""}, "mixed": {"type": "mixed", "main": [{"type": "web", "index": 0, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 1, "all": false}, {"type": "videos", "all": true}, {"type": "web", "index": 2, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 3, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 4, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 5, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 6, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 7, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 8, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 9, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 10, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 11, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 12, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 13, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 14, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 15, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 16, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 17, "all": false}, {"type": "web", "index": 18, "all": false}], "top": [], "side": []}, "type": "search", "videos": {"type": "videos", "results": [{"type": "video_result", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d85UH1J3Sk", "title": "Best AI Code Review Tool for Developers in 2025 | Bito vs Greptile ...", "description": "This is the second video of \"Comparing AI Code Review Tools\" series.

[...] SOAR, developed in 1983 by John Laird, Allen Newell, and Paul Rosenbloom at Carnegie Mellon University, is a pioneering cognitive architecture designed to model human-like reasoning and general intelligence. Rooted deeply in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, SOAR aims to create fixed computational building blocks for general intelligent agents capable of performing a wide array of tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, planning, and natural language understanding. The architecture embodies a unified theory of cognition, evolving from Allen Newell\u2019s Problem Space Hypothesis\u2014a foundational AI theory stating that all goal-directed behavior can be framed as search within a space of possible states.

This overview is the basis for the findings presented in the next section. 5.1 Architecture overview The Phoenix architecture is based on MLS. MLS defines how clients interact but deliberately leaves it open how, for example, identities are established or how clients fetch messages. These open ends are tied together by the Phoenix protocol.

These detailed recommendations are designed to provide further clarity on how to strengthen the development processes. We group our suggestions into three categories: The attacker, the protocol, and the defense. 8.1 Attacker Adversary: Design around an honest-but-curious attacker The Phoenix protocol is designed to primarily defend against the so-called snapshot attacker.

Quantum computers, like classical computers, are problem-solving machines. But instead of bits, quantum computing uses qubits. Qubits are used to process data like traditional bits; however, by harnessing quantum phenomena, qubits have access to more complex mathematics for a different type of computation. ### The difference between quantum and classical computing. #### Quantum computing.

In simple terms,\u00a0robotics\u00a0combines science, engineering, and technology to design, construct, operate, and use machines programmed to replicate, substitute, or assist humans in completing tasks of varying complexity. Throughout the years, robotics has developed increasingly sophisticated machines to benefit a wide range of industries. ### Articulated Robots. The articulated robot is a typical type of industrial robot and often resembles a human arm. A common use case of humanoid robots is automating tasks to increase efficiency and cost-savings. ## What industries are using robotics? Many industries are using robotics to benefit their operations. The healthcare industry has turned to robots to free its employees from monotonous and repetitive tasks like cleaning, delivery, dispensing medications, and hospital logistics. One of the earliest adopters of robotics, manufacturing uses robots to increase workforce efficiency, offload monotonous or dangerous tasks, and enable human workers to focus on more complex tasks. ## The Future of Robotics.", "score": 0.7498395, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "title": "Robotics - Wikipedia", "content": "* 4.2.1.4 Six-wheeled robots. * 4.2.1.5 Tracked robots. - 4.2.2 Walking robots. + 5.3 Human-robot interaction. - 5.3.2 Robotic voice. # Robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. They are used in some robot applications. ## Control robotics areas. The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time. ##### Six-wheeled robots. ##### Tracked robots. #### Walking robots. ### Human-robot interaction.

General relativity has been experimentally verified by observations of gravitational lenses, the [orbit](https://www.britannica.com/science/orbit-astronomy) of the [planet](https://www.britannica.com/science/planet) [Mercury](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mercury-planet), the dilation of time in [Earth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth)\u2019s gravitational field, and [gravitational waves](https://www.britannica.com/science/gravitational-wave) from merging black holes.

General relativity is physicist Albert Einstein's understanding of how gravity affects the fabric of space-time. Special relativity argued that space and time are inextricably connected, but that theory didn't acknowledge the existence of gravity. Einstein spent the decade between the two publications determining that particularly massive objects warp the fabric of space-time, a distortion that manifests as gravity, according to NASA. As he worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity, Einstein realized that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time. General relativity is a physical theory about space and time and it has a beautiful mathematical description. Using Einstein\u2019s theory of curved space-time, the precession of Mercury\u2019s perihelion should advance slightly more than under the predictions of Newton, since planets don\u2019t orbit the sun in a static elliptical orbit.
