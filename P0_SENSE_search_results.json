This overview is the basis for the findings presented in the next section. 5.1 Architecture overview The Phoenix architecture is based on MLS. MLS defines how clients interact but deliberately leaves it open how, for example, identities are established or how clients fetch messages. These open ends are tied together by the Phoenix protocol. The Phoenix architectural center is the home server which consists of three components: The Authentication service, [...] a low severity, another potential mitigation is to explain this issue and its potential mitigations at the implementation level. Phoenix Architecture Review Public, Page 34 of 39 8 Detailed recommendations In addition to the high-level recommendations outlined above, we propose a series of more specific and actionable steps to address some key areas of concern. These detailed recommendations are designed to provide further clarity on how to strengthen the development processes. We group our suggestions into three categories: The attacker, the protocol, and the defense. 8.1 Attacker Adversary: Design around an honest-but-curious attacker The Phoenix protocol is designed to primarily defend against the so-called snapshot attacker. The snapshot attacker can read data at a certain point in",

It can be seen that the proposed 55MW HFO-fired power plant will not have any lasting adverse environmental impacts on the project area during the construction phase. Implementation of the proposed project would have a limited amount of, short-term, local impacts on flora and fauna, noise level, water resources, air quality, navigation and traffic movement. It is not expected, however, that any of the above effects would persist over an extended period beyond the installation phase of this project.
